<i>The Britains discomfited, sore wounded, slaine, and disabled by Plautius and his power,
Claudius the Romane taketh the chiefe citie of Cymbeline the king of Britaine, he
bereaueth the Britains of their armour, and by vertue of his conquest ouer part of the
land is surnamed Britannicus</i>.</p>




<h3>THE FIRST CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Now Plautius had much adoo to find out the Britains in their lurking holes and couerts;
howbeit when he had traced them out, first he vanquished Cataratacus, and
after Togodumnus the sonnes of Cynobellinus: for their father was dead not verie long
before. These therefore fléeing their waies, Plautus receiued part of the people called
<span class="rightnote">Bodumni Catuellani</span>
Bodumni (which were subiects vnto them that were called Catuellani) into the obeisance of
the Romans: and so leauing there a garrison of souldiors, passed further till he came to a
riuer which could not well be passed without a bridge: wherevpon the Britains tooke
small regard to defend the passage, as though they had béene sure inough. But Plautius
appointed a certeine number of Germans which he had there with him (being vsed to
swim ouer riuers although neuer so swift) to get ouer, which they did, sleaing and wounding
the Britains horsses, which were fastened to their wagons or chariots, so that the Britains
were not able to doo anie péece of their accustomed seruice with the same.</p>
<p>
Herewithall was Flauius Vespasianus (that afterwards was emperour) with his brother
Sabinus sent ouer that riuer, which being got to the further side, slue a great number of
the enimies. The residue of the Britains fled, but the next day proffered a new battell, in
the which they fought so stoutlie, that the victorie depended long in doubtfull balance, till
Caius Sidius Geta being almost at point to be taken, did so handle the matter, that the
Britains finallie were put to flight: for the which his valiant dooings, triumphant honors
were bestowed vpon him, although he was no consull.</p>
<p>
The Britains after this battell, withdrew to the riuer of Thames, néere to the place where<span class="page"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>[Page&nbsp;483]</span>
it falleth into the sea, and knowing the shallowes and firme places thereof, easilie passed
ouer to the further side, whom the Romans following, through lacke of knowledge in the
nature of the places, they fell into the marish grounds, and so came to lose manie of their
men, namelie of the Germans, which were the first that passed ouer the riuer to follow the
Britains, partlie by a bridge which lay within the countrie ouer the said riuer, and partlie by
swimming, and other such shift as they presentlie made.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
<i>Togodumnus</i></span>
The Britains hauing lost one of their rulers, namelie Togodumnus (of whom ye haue
heard before) were nothing discouraged, but rather more egerlie set on reuenge. Plautius
perceiuing their fiercenesse, went no further, but staid and placed garrisons in steeds where
néed required, to keepe those places which he had gotten, and with all spéed sent aduertisement
vnto Claudius, according to that he had in commandement, if anie vrgent necessitie
should so mooue him. Claudius therefore hauing all things before hand in a readinesse,
straightwaies vpon the receiuing of the aduertisement, departed from Rome, and came by
water vnto Ostia, and from thence vnto Massilia, and so through France sped his iournies
till he came to the side of the Ocean sea, and then imbarking himselfe with his people,
passed ouer into Britaine, and came to his armie which abode his comming néere the Thames
side, where being ioined, they passed the riuer againe, fought with the Britains in a pitcht
field, and getting the victorie, tooke the towne of Camelodunum (which some count to be
Colchester) being the chiefest citie apperteining vnto Cynobelinus. He reduced also manie
other people into his subiection, some by force, and some by surrender, whereof he was
called oftentimes by the name of emperour, which was against the ordinance of the Romans:
for it was not lawfull for anie to take that name vpon him oftener than once in anie one
voiage. Moreouer, Claudius tooke from the Britains their armor and weapons, and committed
the gouernment of them vnto Plautius, commanding him to endeuour himselfe to
subdue the residue.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">
<i>Dion Cassius</i></span>
Thus hauing brought vnder a part of Britaine, and hauing made his abode therin not
past a sixtene daies, he departed and came backe againe to Rome with victorie in the sixt
<span class="leftnote"><i>Suetonius</i></span>
month after his setting foorth from thence, giuing after his returne, to his sonne, the surname
of Britannicus. This warre he finished in maner as before is said, in the fourth
yéere of his reigne, which fell in the yéere of the world 4011, after the birth of our Sauiour
44, and after the building of Rome 797.</p>

<i>The diuerse opinions and variable reports of writers touching the partile conquest of this
Iland by the Romans, the death of Guiderius.</i></p>

<h3>THE SECOND CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
There be that write, how Claudius subdued and added to the Romane empire, the
Iles of Orknie situate in the north Ocean beyond Britaine: which might well be accomplished
either by Plautius, or some other his lieutenant: for Plautius indéed for his noble
prowesse and valiant acts atchieued in Britaine, afterwards triumphed. Titus the sonne of
Vespasian also wan no small praise for deliuering his father out of danger in his time, being
beset with a companie of Britains, which the said Titus bare downe, and put to flight with
great slaughter. Beda following the authoritie of Suetonius, writeth bréeflie of this matter,
and saith, that Claudius passing ouer into this Ile, to the which neither before Iulius Cesar,
neither after him anie stranger durst come, within few daies receiued the most part of the
countrie into his subiection without battell or bloudshed.</p>
<p>
Gyldas also writing of this reuolting of the Britains, saith thus: "When information
thereof was giuen to the senate, and that hast was made with a spéedie armie to reuenge
the same, there was no warlike nauie prepared in the sea to fight valiantlie for the defense<span class="page"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>[Page&nbsp;484]</span>
of the countrie, no square battell, no right wing, nor anie other prouision appointed on the
shore to be séene, but the backes of the Britains in stead of a shield are shewed to the persecutors,
and their necks readie to be cut off with the sword through cold feare running
through their bones, which stretched foorth their hands to be bound like womanlie creatures;
so that a common prouerbe followed thereof, to wit, That the Britains were neither
valiant in warre, nor faithfull in peace: and so the Romans sleaing manie of the rebels,
reseruing some, and bringing them to bondage, that the land should not lie altogither vntilled
and desert, returned into Italie out of that land which was void of wine and oile,
leauing some of their men there for gouernors to chastise the people, not so much with an
armie of men, as with scourge and whip, and if the matter so required, to applie the naked
sword vnto their sides: so that it might be accounted Rome and not Britaine. And what
coine either of brasse, siluer or gold there was, the same to be stamped with the image of
the emperour." Thus farre Gildas.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gal. Mon. Matth. West.</i></span>
In the British historie we find other report as thus, that Claudius at his comming aland
at Porchester, besieged that towne, to the rescue whereof came Guiderius, and giuing battell
to the Romans, put them to the woorse, till at length one Hamo, being on the Romans
side, changed his shield and armour, apparelling himselfe like a Britaine, and so entring
into the thickest prease of the British host, came at length where the king was, and there
slue him. But Aruiragus perceiuing this mischiefe, to the end the Britains should not be
discouraged therewith, caused himselfe to be adorned with the kings cote-armor, and other
abiliments, and so as king continued the fight with such manhood, that the Romans were
put to flight. Claudius retired backe to his ships, and Hamo to the next woods, whom
Aruiragus pursued, and at length droue him vnto the sea side, and there slue him yer he
could take the hauen which was there at hand; so that the same tooke name of him, and
was called a long time after, Hamons hauen, and at length by corruption of speach it was
<span class="rightnote">Hampton, why so called.</span>
called Hampton, and so continueth vnto this day, commonlie called by the name of Southhampton.
Thus haue you heard how Guiderius or Guinderius (whether you will) came
to his end, which chanced (as some write) in the 28 yéere of his reigne.</p>

<i>Aruiragus the Britaine &amp; Claudius the Romane with their armies doo incounter, a composition
concerning mariage concluded betweene them, Claudius returneth to Rome.</i></p>

<h3>THE THIRD CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">ARUIRAGUS. <i>Hector Boet.</i></span>
Aruiragus the yoongest son of Kymbeline, and brother to Guinderius (bicause the same)
Guinderius left no issue to succéed him) was admitted king of Britaine in the yeere
of our Lord 45, or rather 46.</p>
<p>
This Aruiragus, otherwise called by the Britains Meuricus or Mauus, of Tacitus Prasutagus,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Caxton</i>.</span>
is also named Armiger in the English chronicle, by which chronicle (as appéereth) he
bare himselfe right manfullie against Claudius and his Romans in the war which they made
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gal. Mon</i>.</span>
against him: in so much that when Claudius had renewed his force and woone Porchester,
and after came to besiege Winchester (in the which Aruiragus as then was inclosed) Aruiragus
assembling his power, was readie to come foorth and giue Claudius battell: wherevpon
Claudius doubting the sequele of the thing, sent messengers vnto Aruiragus to treat of concord,
and so by composition the matter was taken vp, with condition, that Claudius should
giue his daughter Genissa in marriage vnto Aruiragus, &amp; Aruiragus should acknowledge to
hold his kingdome of the Romans.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ranulfus Cestrensis</i>.</span>
Some write that Claudius in fauour of the valiant prowesse which he saw &amp; found in
Aruiragus, honored not onlie him with the mariage of his daughter the said Genissa, but<span class="page"><a name="page485" id="page485"></a>[Page&nbsp;485]</span>
also to the end to make the towne more famous where this marriage was solemnized, he
therefore called it Claudiocestria, after his name, the which in the British toong was called
before that daie Caerleon, and after Glouernia, of a duke that ruled in Demetia that hight
Glunie, but now it is called Glocester.</p>
<p>
Other there be that write, how Claudius being vanquished in battell by Aruiragus, was
compelled by the said Aruiragus to giue vnto him his said daughter to wife, with condition
as before is mentioned: and that then Aruiragus was crowned king of Britaine. But
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sueton.</i></span>
Suetonius maie séeme to reprooue this part of the British historie, which in the life of
Claudius witnesseth, that he had by thrée wiues onlie three daughters, that is to saie, Claudia,
Antonia, and Octauia: and further, that reputing Claudia not to be his, caused hir to be
cast downe at the doore of his wife Herculanilla, whome he had forsaken by waie of diuorcement:
&amp; that he bestowed his daughter Antonia first on C. Pompeius Magnus, and
after on Faustus Silla, verie noble yoong gentlemen; and Octauia he matched with Nero
his wiues son. Whereby it should appéere, that this supposed marriage betwixt Aruiragus
and the daughter of Claudius is but a feined tale.</p>
<p>
¶ And héere to speake my fansie also what I thinke of this Aruiragus, and other the kings
(whome Galfrid and such as haue followed him doo register in order, to succéed one after
another) I will not denie but such persons there were, and the same happilie bearing verie
great rule in the land, but that they reigned as absolute kings ouer the whole, or that they
succéeded one after another in manner as is auouched by the same writers, it seemeth most
vnlike to be true: for rather it maie be gessed by that, which as well Gyldas as the old
approoued Romane writers haue written, that diuerse of these kings liued about one time,
or in times greatlie differing from those times which in our writers we find noted. As for
example, Iuuenal maketh this Aruiragus, of whom we now intreat, to reigne about Domitians
time. For my part therefore, sith this order of the British kinglie succession in this
place is more easie to be flatlie denied and vtterlie reprooued, than either wiselie defended or
trulie amended, I will referre the reforming therof vnto those that haue perhaps séene more
than I haue, or more déepelie considered the thing, to trie out an vndoubted truth: in the
meane time, I haue thought good, both to shew what I find in our histories, and likewise
in forren writers, to the which we thinke (namelie in this behalfe, whilest the Romans
gouerned there) we maie safelie giue most credit, doo we otherwise neuer so much content
our selues with other vaine and fond conceits.</p>
<p>
To procéed yet with the historie as we find it by our writers set foorth: it is reported,
that after the solemnization of this marriage, which was doone with all honour that might
<span class="rightnote">Legions of souldiers sent into Ireland.</span>
be deuised, Claudius sent certeine legions of souldiers foorth to go into Ireland to subdue
that countrie, and returned himselfe to Rome.</p>

<h3>THE FOURTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Then did king Aruiragus ride about to view the state of his realme, repairing cities and
townes decaied by the warre of the Romans, and saw his people gouerned with such iustice
and good order, that he was both feared and greatlie beloued: so that in tract of time he
grew verie welthie, and by reason thereof fell into pride, so that he denied his subiection
<span class="rightnote">Vespasian in Britaine. <i>Cornel. Tacit.
in uit. Agr. lib. 3 &amp; li. 6. Gal. Mon. Rutupium.</i></span><span class="page"><a name="page486" id="page486"></a>[Page&nbsp;486]</span>
to the Romans. Wherevpon Claudius appointed Vespasian with an armie to go as lieutenant
into Britaine. This iournie was to him the beginning of his advancement to that honour,
which after to him most luckilie befell. But if we shall credit our Britaine writers, he
gained not much at Aruiragus hands, for where he would haue landed at Sandwich or Richborough,
Aruiragus was readie to resist him, so as he durst not once enter the hauen: for
Aruiragus had there such a puissant number of armed men, that the Romans were afraid to
approach the land.</p>
<p>
Vespasian therefore withdrew from thence, and coasting westward, landed at Totnesse,
and comming to Excester, besieged that citie: but about the seuenth day after he had
planted his siege, came Aruiragus, and gaue him battell, in the which both the armies
sustained great losse of men, and neither part got anie aduantage of the other. On the
morrow after quéene Genissa made them friends, and so the warres ceassed for that time, by
hir good mediation.</p>
<p>
¶ But séeing (as before I haue said) the truth of this historie maie be greatlie mistrusted,
ye shall heare what the Romane writers saie of Vespasianus being héere in Britaine, beside
that which we haue alreadie recited out of Dion in the life of Guiderius.</p>
<p>
In the daies of the emperor Claudius, through fauour of Narcissus (one that might doo
all with Claudius) the said Vespasian was sent as coronell or lieutenant of a legion of
<span class="rightnote">Vespasian. <i>Suetonius. Salcellicus.</i></span>
souldiers into Germanie, and being remooued from thence into Britaine, he fought thirtie
seuerall times with the enimies, and brought vnto the Romane obeisance two most mightie
nations, and aboue twentie townes, togither with the Ile of Wight; and these exploits he
atchiued, partlie vnder the conduct of Aulus Plautius ruler of Britaine for the emperor
Claudius, and partlie vnder the same emperor himselfe. For as it is euident by writers of
good credit, he came first ouer into Britaine with the said Aulus Plautius, and serued verie
valiantlie vnder him, as before in place we haue partlie touched. By Tacitus it appeareth,
that he was called to be partener in the gouernment of things in Britaine with Claudius, and
had such successe, as it appéered to what estate of honour he was predestinate, hauing conquered
nations, and taken kings prisoners. But now to make an end with Aruiragus:
when he perceiued that his force was too weake to preuaile against the Romane empire,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gal. Mon.</i></span>
and that he should striue but in vaine to shake the yoke of subiection from the necks of
the Britains, he made a finall peace with them in his old age, and so continued in quiet the
residue of his reigne, which he lastlie ended by death, after he had gouerned the land by
the space of thirtie yéeres, or but eight and twentie, as some other imagine. He died in
<span class="leftnote">73.</span>

appeaseth the Yorkshiremen, and brideleth the rage of the Silures.</i></p>

<h3>THE FIFT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
In the daies of the said Aruiragus, about the yeare of Christ 53, Ioseph of Arimathia,
who buried the bodie of our sauiour, being sent by Philip the Apostle (as Iohn Bale following
the authoritie of Gildas and other British writers reciteth) after that the Christians
were dispersed out of Gallia, came into Britaine with diuers other godlie christian men, &amp;
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydorus.</i></span>
preaching the gospell there amongst the Britains, &amp; instructing them in the faith and lawes
of Christ, conuerted manie to the true beliefe, and baptised them in the wholsome water
of regeneration, &amp; there continued all the residue of his life, obteining of the king a plot
of ground where to inhabit, not past a foure miles from Wells, and there with his fellowes<span class="page"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>[Page&nbsp;487]</span>
began to laie the first foundation of the true and perfect religion, in which place (or
néere thereinto) was afterward erected the abbeie of Glastenburie.</p>
<p>
Nicephorus writeth in his second booke and fourth chapter, that one Simon Zelotes came
likewise into Britaine. And Theodoretus in his 9. booke "De curandis Græcorum affectibus,"
sheweth that Paule being released of his second imprisonment, and suffered to depart from
Rome, preached the gospell to the Britains and to other nations in the west. The same
thing in manner dooth Sophronius the patriarch of Ierusalem witnesse, Tertullian also maie
be a witnesse of the ancientnes of the faith receiued here in Britaine, where he writing of
these times saith: Those places of the Britains, to the which the Romans could not approch,
were subiect vnto Christ, as were also the countries of Sarmatia, Dacia, Germania,
Scithia, and others. ¶ Thus it maie appeare, that the christian religion was planted here
in this land shortlie after Christes time, although it certeinlie appeareth not who were the
first that preached the gospell to the Britains, nor whether they were Gréeks or Latins.</p>
<p>
Cornelius Tacitus writeth, that the Romane emperours in this season gouerned this land
<span class="rightnote">Treasurers or receiuers.</span>
by lieutenants and treasurers, the which were called by the name of legats and procurators,
thereby to kéepe the vnrulie inhabitants the better in order.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Aulus Plautius.</span>
And Aulus Plautius a noble man of Rome of the order of consuls, was sent hither as the
<span class="leftnote">Ostorius Scapula.</span>
first legat or lieutenant (in maner as before ye haue heard) &amp; after him Ostorius Scapula,
who at his comming found the Ile in trouble, the enimies hauing made inuasion into the
countrie of those that were friends to the Romans, the more presumptuouslie, for that they
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tacitus lib. 12.</i></span>
thought a new lieutenant, with an armie to him vnacquainted and come ouer now in the
beginning of winter, would not be hastie to march foorth against them. But Ostorius vnderstanding
that by the first successe and chance of warre, feare or hope is bred and augmented,
hasted forward to encounter with them, and such as he found abroad in the
countrie he slue out right on euerie side, and pursued such as fled, to the end they should
not come togither againe. Now for that a displeasing and a doubtfull peace was not like to
bring quietnesse either to him or to his armie, he tooke from such as he suspected, their
armour. And after this, he went about to defend the riuers of Auon &amp; Seuerne, with
placing his souldiers in camps fortified néere to the same. But the Oxfordshire men and
other of those parties would not suffer him to accomplish his purpose in anie quiet sort,
being a puissant kind of people, and not hitherto weakened by warres: for they willinglie
<span class="righnote">Cornelius Tacit. lib. 12.</span>
at the first had ioined in amitie with the Romans. The countries adjoining also being induced
by their procurement, came to them, &amp; so they chose forth a plot of ground, fensed
with a mightie ditch, vnto the which there was no waie to enter but one, &amp; the same verie
narrow, so as the horssemen could not haue anie easie passage to breake in vpon them.
Ostorius, although he had no legionarie souldiers, but certeine bands of aids, marched foorth
towards the place within the which the Britains were lodged, and assaulting them in the
same, brake through into their campe, where the Britains being impeached with their owne
inclosures which they had raised for defense of the place, knowing how that for their rebellion
they were like to find small mercie at the Romans hands, when they saw now no
waie to escape, laid about them manfullie, and shewed great proofe of their valiant stomachs.</p>
<p>
In this battell, the sonne of Ostorius the lieutenant deserued the price and commendation
<span class="rightnote">which was a certaine crowne, to be set on his head called <i>ciuica corona.</i></span>
of preseruing a citizen out of the cruell enimies hands. But now with this slaughter of the
Oxfordshire men, diuers of the Britains that stood doubtfull what waie to take, either to
rest in quiet, or to moue warres, were contented to be conformable vnto a reasonable order
<span class="leftnote">Cangi.</span>
of peace, in so much that Ostorius lead his armie against the people called Cangi, who inhabited
that part of Wales now called Denbighshire, which countrie he spoiled on euerie
side, no enimie once daring to encounter him: &amp; if anie of them aduentured priuilie to set
vpon those which they found behind, or on the outsids of his armie, they were cut short
yer they could escape out of danger. Wherevpon he marched straight to their campe and
giuing them battell, vanquished them: and vsing the victorie as reason moued him, he lead
his armie against those that inhabited the inner parts of Wales, spoiling the countrie on<span class="page"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>[Page&nbsp;488]</span>
euerie side. And thus sharplie pursuing the rebels, he approched néere vnto the sea side,
which lieth ouer against Ireland. While this Romane capteine was thus occupied, he was
called backe by the rebellion of the Yorkshire men, whome forthwith vpon his comming
vnto them, he appeased, punishing the first authors of that tumult with death.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tacitus. lib</i>. 12</span>
In the meane time, the people called Silures, being a verie fierce kind of men, and valiant,
prepared to make warre against the Romans, for they might not be bowed neither with
roughnesse, nor yet with any courteous handling, so that they were to be tamed by an armie
of legionarie souldiers to be brought among them.</p>
<p>
Therefore to restraine the furious rage of those people and their neighbours, Ostorious
peopled a towne néere to their borders, called Camelodunum with certeine bands of old
souldiers, there to inhabit with their wiues and children, according to such maner as was
vsed in like cases of placing naturall Romans in anie towne or citie, for the more suertie and
defense of the same. Here also was a temple builded in the honor of Claudius the emperour,
where were two images erected, one of the goddesse Victoria, and an other of
Claudius himselfe.</p>

Britains go miserablie to wracke, Caratacus is deliuered to the Romans, his wife and
daughter are taken prisoners, his brethren yeeld themselues to their enimies.</i></p>



<h3>THE SIXT CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
But now there resteth a great doubt among writers, where this citie or towne called Camelodunum
did stand, of some (and not without good ground of probable coniectures
gathered vpon the aduised consideration of the circumstances of that which in old authors is
<span class="rightnote">Camelodunum, Colchester.</span>
found written of this place) it is thought to be Colchester. But verelie by this place of Tacitus
it maie rather seeme to be some other towne, situat more westward than Colchester, sith a
colonie of Romane souldiers were planted there to be at hand, for the repressing of the
<span class="leftnote">Silures where they inhabited.</span>
vnquiet Silures, which by consent of most writers inhabited in Southwales, or néere the
Welsh marshes.</p>
<p>
There was a castell of great fame in times past that hight Camaletum, or in British Caermalet,
which stood in the marshes of Summersetshire; but sith there is none that hath so
written before this time, I will not saie that happilie some error hath growne by mistaking
the name of Camelodunum for this Camaletum, by such as haue copied out the booke of
Cornelius Tacitus; and yet so it might be doon by such as found it short or vnperfectlie
written, namelie, by such strangers or others, to whom onelie the name of Camelodunum
was onelie knowne, and Camaletum peraduenture neuer séene nor heard of. As for example,
an Englishman that hath heard of Waterford in Ireland, and not of Wexford, might in
taking foorth a copie of some writing easilie commit a fault in noting the one for the other.
We find in Ptolomie Camedolon to be a citie belonging to the Trinobants, and he maketh
mention also of Camelodunum, but Humfrey Lhoyd thinketh that he meaneth all one citie.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding Polydor Virgil is of a contrarie opinion, supposing the one to be Colchester
in déed, and the other that is Camelodunum to be Doncaster or Pontfret. Leland
esteeming it to be certeinelie Colchester taketh the Iceni men also to be the Northfolke
men. But howsoeuer we shall take this place of Tacitus, it is euident inough that Camelodunum
stood not farre from the Thames. And therefore to séeke it with Hector Boetius
in Scotland, or with Polydor Virgil so far as Doncaster or Pontfret, it maie be thought a<span class="page"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[Page&nbsp;489]</span>
plaine error.</p>
<p>
But to leaue each man to his owne iudgement in a matter so doubtfull, we will procéed
with the historie as touching the warres betwixt the Romans and the Silurians, against whome
(trusting not onelie vpon their owne manhood, but also vpon the high prowesse &amp; valiancie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cornelius Tacitus lib. Anna. 12</i>.</span>
of Caratacus) Ostorius set forward. Caratacus excelled in fame aboue all other the princes
of Britaine, aduanced thereto by manie doubtfull aduentures and manie prosperous exploits,
which in his time he had atchiued: but as he was in policie and aduantage of place better
prouided than the Romans: so in power of souldiers he was ouermatched. And therefore
<span class="leftnote"><i>Hu. Lhoyd</i>.</span>
he remoued the battell into the parts of that countrie where the Ordouices inhabited, which
are thought to haue dwelled in the borders of Shropshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire, which
people together with other that misliked of the Romane gouernment, he ioined in one, and
chose a plot of ground for his aduantage, determining there to trie the vttermost hazard
of battell.</p>
<p>
The place which he thus chose was such, as the entries, the backwaies, and the whole
situation thereof made for the Britains aduantage, and cleane contrarie to the Romans, as
inclosed among high hils. And if there were anie easie passage to enter it vpon anie side,
the same was shut vp with mightie huge stones in manner of a rampire, and afore it there
ran a riuer without anie certeine foord to passe ouer it. This place is supposed to lie in the
confines of Shropshire aloft vpon the top of an high hill there, enuironed with a triple
rampire and ditch of great depth, hauing thrée entries into it, not directlie one against an other,
but aslope. It is also (they saie) compassed about with two riuers, to wit, on the left hand
with the riuer called Clun, &amp; on the right hand with an other called Teuid. On thrée sides
thereof the clime is verie stéepe and headlong, and no waie easie to come or reach vnto it,
but onelie one.</p>
<p>
Caratac hauing thus fortified himselfe within this place, and brought his armie into it: to
encourage his people, he exhorted them to shew their manhood, affirming that to be the
day, and that armie to be the same wherein should appeare the beginning either of libertie
then to be recouered, or else of perpetuall bondage for euer to be susteined. He rehersed
also speciallie by name those their elders, which had resisted Iulius Cesar, by whose high
valiancie they liued free from the bloudie thraldome and tributes of the Romans, and enioied
their wiues and children safe and vndefiled. Thus discoursing of manie things with
them, in such hope of assured victorie, that they began to raise their cries, each one for
him selfe, declaring that he was bound by the dutie he owght to the gods of his countrie,
not to shrinke for feare of anie wounds or hurts that might chance vnto them by the enimies
weapon.</p>
<p>
This chéerefulnesse of the Britains greatlie astonished the Romane lieutenant. The hideous
course also of the riuer before his face, the fortifications and craggie higth of the hils,
all set full of enimies readie to beat him backe, put him in great feare: for nothing he saw
afore him, but that which séemed dreadfull to those that should assaile. But the souldiers
yet séemed to be verie desirous of battell, requesting him to bring them to it, protesting that
nothing was able to resist the force of noble prowes. Herewith the capteins and tribunes
discoursing the like, pricked forward the earnest willes which their souldiers had to fight.</p>
<p>
Ostorius perceiuing such courage and readie wils in the men of warre, as well souldiers as
capteins, began to bestirre himselfe, and left nothing vndone that might serue to set forward
their earnest desire to battell. And hauing aduisedlie considered which waies were hard and
<span class="rightnote">Cornelius Tacitus Annal. lib. 12.</span>
vnpossible to be entered vpon, and which were most easie for his people to find passage by,
he led them foorth, being most earnestlie bent to cope with the enimie.</p>
<p>
Now hauing passed the water without any great difficultie, but comming to the rampire, he
lost manie of his people, so long as the fight was continued with shot and casting of darts:
but after that the Romans couering themselues with their targets, came once close togither,
and approched vnder the rampire, they remooued away the stones which the Britains had
roughlie couched togither, and so came to ioine with them at handblowes. The Britains<span class="page"><a name="page490" id="page490"></a>[Page&nbsp;490]</span>
being vnarmed, and not able to abide the force of the armed men, withdrew to the top of
the hilles, but as well their enimies that were light armed, as the other with heauie armour,
followed and brake in among them, so as the Britains could not turne them anie way to
escape, for the light armed men with shot a farre off, and the heauie armed with weapons at
hand, sought to make slaughter and wracke of them on ech side, so that this was a verie
dolefull day to the Britains.</p>
<p>
The wife and daughter of Caratake were taken prisoners, and his brethren also yéelded
themselues. He himselfe escaped, and committing his person vnto the assurance &amp; trust of
Cartemandua queene of the Brigants, was by hir deliuered into the hands of the Romans.
All this happened about nine yeres after the warres in Britaine first began.</p>

<h3>THE SEUENTH CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cornelius Tacit. lib. 12.</i>Carataks name renowmed.</span>
The name of Caratacus being brought out of the Iles was alreadie spred ouer the prouinces
adioining, and began now to grow famous through Italie. Men therefore were desirous
to sée what maner of man he was that had so manie yéeres set at naught the puissant force
of the empire. For in Rome the name of Caratacus was much spoken of, insomuch that
the emperour whilest he went about to preferre his owne honour, aduanced the glorie of
him also that was vanquished: for the people were called foorth as vnto some great notable
sight or spectacle. The pretorian bands stood in order of battell armed in the field that laie
before their lodgings, through which field Caratake shuld come. Then passed by the traine
of his friends and seruants; and such armor, riches, iewels, and other things as had béene
gotten in those warres, were borne forward, and openlie shewed, that all men might behold
the same.</p>
<p>
After these followed his brethren, wife, and daughters: and last of all came Caratacus
himselfe, whose countenance was nothing like to theirs that went afore him. For whereas
they fearing punishment for their rebellion with wailefull countenance craued mercie, he
neither by countenance nor words shewd anie token of a discouraged mind, but being
presented before the emperour Claudius sitting in his tribunall seat, he vttered this speach
as followeth.</p>
<p>
"If there had béene in me so much moderation in time of prosperitie, as there was nobilitie
<span class="rightnote">[<i>* Sic.</i>]</span>
of birth and puissance, I had come to this citie rather as a friend than as a capteine *:
neither should I haue thought scorne, being borne of most noble parents, and ruling ouer
many people, to haue accepted peace by waie of ioining with you in league. My present
estate as it is to me reprochfull, so to you it is honorable. I had at commandement, horsses,
men, armor, and great riches; what maruell is it if I were loth to forgo the same? For if
you shall looke to gouerne all men, it must néeds follow that all men must be your slaues.
If I had at the first yéelded my selfe, neither my power nor your glorie had béene set foorth
to the world, &amp; vpon mine execution I should straight haue béene forgotten. But if you now
grant me life, I shall be a witnesse for euer of your mercifull clemencie."</p>
<p>
The emperour with these words being pacified, granted life both to Caratake, and also to
his wife and brethren, who being loosed from their bands, went also to the place where the
empresse Agrippina sat (not farre off) in a chaire of estate, whom they reuerenced with the<span class="page"><a name="page491" id="page491"></a>[Page&nbsp;491]</span>
like praise and thanks as they had doone before to the emperour. After this the senat was called
togither, who discoursed of manie things touching this honourable victorie atchiued by the
taking of Caratake, estéeming the same no lesse glorious, than when P. Scipio shewed in
<span class="rightnote">Siphax. L. Paulus.</span>
triumph Siphax king of the Numidians, or L. Paulus the Macedonian king Perses, or other
Romane capteins anie such king whom they had vanquished.</p>
<p>
Héerevpon it was determined, that Ostorius should enter the citie of Rome with triumph
like a conqueror, for such prosperous successe as hitherto had followed him: but afterwards
his procéedings were not so luckie, either for that after Caratake was remooued out of the
waie, or bicause the Romans (as though the warre had béene finished) looked negligentlie to
themselues, either else for that the Britains taking compassion of the miserable state of
Caratake, being so worthie a prince, through fortunes froward aspect cast into miserie, were
more earnestlie set to reuenge his quarrell. Héerevpon they incompassed the maister of the
campe, and those legionarie bands of souldiers which were left amongst the Silures to fortifie
a place there for the armie to lodge in: and if succour had not come out of the next towns
and castels, the Romans had béene destroied by siege. The head capteine yet, and eight
centurions, and euerie one else of the companies being most forward, were slaine. Shortlie
after they set vpon the Romane forragers, and put them to flight, and also such companies of
horssemen as were appointed to gard them. Héerevpon Ostorius set foorth certeine bands
of light horssemen, but neither could he staie the flight by that meanes, till finallie the
legions entred the battell, by whose force they were staid, and at length the Romans obteined
the better: but the Britains escaped by flight without great losse, by reason the daie
was spent.</p>
<p>
After this, manie bickerings chanced betwixt the Britains and Romans, &amp; oftentimes they
wrought their feats more like the trade of them that vse to rob by the high waies, than of
those that make open warre, taking their enimies at some aduantage in woods and bogs, as
hap or force ministred occasion vpon malice conceiued, or in hope of prey, sometimes by commandement,
and sometimes without either commandement or knowledge of capteine or officer.</p>
<p>
At one time the Britains surprised two bands of footmen that were with the Romans in
aid, and sent foorth to forreie abroad vnaduisedlie, through couetousnesse of the capteins.
This feat was atchiued by the Silures also, the which in bestowing prisoners and part of the
spoile vpon other of their neighbours, procured them likewise to rebell against the Romans,
and to take part with them. The Silures were the more earnestlie set against the Romans,
by occasion of words which the emperor Claudius had vttered in their disfauour, as thus:
that euen as the Sicambres were destroied and remooued into Gallia, so likewise must the
Silures be dealt with, and the whole nation of them extinguished. These words being blowne
abroad, and knowne ouer all, caused the Silures to conceiue a woonderfull hatred against the
Romans, so that they were fullie bent, either to reteine their libertie, or to die in defense
thereof vpon the enimies swoord.</p>
<p>
In the meane time Ostorius Scapula departed this life, a right noble warrior, and one who
by litle &amp; litle insuing the steps of Aulus Plautius his predecessor, did what he could to bring
the Ile into the forme of a prouince, which in part he accomplished.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.H.</i> in his chronologie.</span>
There be some led by coniecture grounded vpon good aduised considerations, that suppose
this Ostorius Scapula began to build the citie of Chester after the ouerthrow of Caratacus:
for in those parties he fortified sundrie holds, and placed a number of old souldiers either
there in that selfe place, or in some other néere therevnto by waie of a colonie. And for somuch
(saie they) as we read of none other of anie name thereabouts, it is to be thought that
he planted the same in Chester, where his successors did afterwards vse to harbour their
legions for the winter season, and in time of rest from iournies which they haue to make
against their common enimies.</p>
<p>
In déed it is a common opinion among the people there vnto this daie, that the Romans
built those vaults or tauerns (which in that citie are vnder the ground) with some part of the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ran. Hig.</i> alias <i>Cestrensis.</i></span><span class="page"><a name="page492" id="page492"></a>[Page&nbsp;492]</span>
castell. And verelie as Ranulfe Higden saith, a man that shall view and well consider those
buildings, maie thinke the same to be the woorke of Romans rather than of anie other people.
That the Romane legions did make their abode there, no man séene in antiquities can doubt
thereof, for the ancient name <i>Caer leon ardour deuy,</i> that is, The citie of legions vpon the
water of Dée, proueth it sufficientlie enough.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Corn. Tacit.</i></span>
But to returne vnto Ostorius Scapula, we find in Corn. Tacitus, that during his time of
<span class="rightnote">Cogidune a king in Britane.</span>
being lieutenant in this Ile, there were certeine cities giuen vnto one Cogidune a king of the
Britains, who continued faithfull to the Romans vnto the daies of the remembrance of men
liuing in the time of the said Cornelius Tacitus, who liued and wrote in the emperor Domitianus
time. This was doone after an old receiued custom of the people of Rome, to haue
both subiects and kings vnder their rule and dominion, as who so shall note the acts and
déeds of the Roman emperours from C. Iulius Cesar (who chased Pompeie out of Italie, and
was the first that obteined the Romane empire to himselfe; of whom also the princes and
emperours succéeding him were called Cesars) to Octauian, Tiberius, Caligula, &amp;c: maie
easilie marke and obserue. For they were a people of singular magnanimitie, of an ambitious
spirit, gréedie of honour and renowme, and not vnaptlie termed "Romani rerum
domini, &amp;c.</p>

<h3>THE EIGHT CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">A. Didius lieutenant.</span>
After the deceasse of Ostorius Scapula, one A. Didius was sent to supplie his roome,
but yer he could come, things were brought out of order, and the Britains had vanquished
the legion whereof Manlius Valens had the conduct: this victorie was set foorth by the
Britains to the vttermost, that with the bruit thereof they might strike a feare into the lieutenants
hart, now vpon his first comming ouer. And he himselfe reported it by letters to
the emperour after the largest manner, to the end that if he appeased the matter, he might
win the more praise; or if he were put to the woorst, and should not preuaile, that then
his excuse might séeme the more reasonable and woorthie of pardon. The Silures were
they that had atchiued this victorie, and kept a fowle stur ouer all the countries about them,
till by the comming of Didius against them, they were driuen backe and repelled.</p>
<p>
But héerewith began trouble to be raised in another part: for after that Caratac was
<span class="leftnote">Venutius ruler of the Iugants.</span>
taken, the chiefest and most skillfull capteine which the Britains had, was one Venutius, a
ruler of the people named Iugants, a man that remained a long time faithfull to the Romans,
<span class="rightnote">Cartimanda.</span>
and by their power was defended from his enimies, who had married with Cartimanda queene
of the Brigants or Yorkeshire men. This Cartimanda (as ye haue heard) had deliuered
Catarac into the Romans hands, thereby ministring matter for the emperour Claudius to
triumph, by which pleasure shewed to the Romans, she increased thorough their friendship
in power and wealth, whereof followed riotous lust to satisfie hir wanton appetite, so as she
<span class="leftnote">Vellocatus.</span>
falling at square with hir husband, married Vellocatus, one of his esquires, to whom she
gaue hir kingdome, and so dishonoured hir selfe. Héerevpon insued cruell warre, in so
much that in the end Venutius became enimie also to the Romans. But first they tugged
togither betwixt themselues, &amp; the quéene by a craftie policie found meanes to catch the
brother and coosens of Venutius, but hir enimies nothing therewith discouraged, but kindled
the more in wrath against hir, ceassed not to go forward with their purpose.</p>
<p>
Manie of the Brigants disdaining to be subiect vnto a womans rule that had so reiected hir<span class="page"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>[Page&nbsp;493]</span>
husband, reuolted vnto Venutius: but yet the quéenes sensuall lust mixed with crueltie,
mainteined the adulterer. Venutius therefore calling to him such aid as he could get, and
strengthened now by the reuolting of the Brigants, brought Cartimanda to such a narrow
point, that she was in great danger to fall into the hands of hir enimies: which the Romans
forséeing, vpon suit made, sent certeine bands of horssemen and footmen to helpe hir.
They had diuerse incounters with the enimies at the first, with doubtfull successe: but at
<span class="rightnote">Venutius kéepeth the kingdome in despite of the Romans.</span>
length they preuailed, and so deliuered the quéene out of perill, but the kingdome remained
to Venutius: against whom the Romans were constreined still to mainteine warre.</p>
<p>
About the same time, the legion also which Cesius Nasica led, got the vpper hand of those
Britains against whom he was sent. For Didius being aged, and by victories past inough
renowmed, thought it sufficient for him to make warre by his capteins, so to staie and kéepe
off the enimie. Certeine castels and holds in déed he caused to be built and fortified,
further within the countrie than had béene afore attempted by anie of his predecessors, and
so thereby were the confines of the Romans in this Ile somewhat inlarged. Thus haue ye
heard with what successe the Britains mainteined warre in defense of their libertie against
the Romans, whilest Claudius ruled the empire (according to the report of the Romane
writers.)</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The error of <i>Hector Boetius.</i></span>
¶ But here you must note, that Hector Boetius, following the authoritie of one Veremond
a Spaniard, of Cornelius Hibernicus, &amp; also of Campbell, remooueth the Silures, Brigants,
and Nouants, so farre northward, that he maketh them inhabitants of those countries which
the Scots haue now in possession, and were euen then inhabited (as he affirmeth) partlie by
the Scots, and partlie by the Picts (as in the Scotish historie ye may sée more at large) so that
what notable feat soeuer was atchiued by the old Britains against the Romans, the same by
him is ascribed to the Scots and Picts throughout his whole historie, whereas (in verie truth)
forsomuch as may be gathered by coniecture und presumption of that which is left in writing
by ancient authors, the Brigants inhabited Yorkshire, the Silures Wales and the Marches,
and the Nouants the countrie of Cumberland.</p>
<p>
But forsomuch as he hath diligentlie gathered in what maner the warres were mainteined by
those people against the Romans, and what valiant exploits were taken in hand and finished
thorough their stoutnesse and valiancie, ye may there read the same, and iudge at your
<span class="rightnote">A note to be considered in the reading of <i>Hect. Boetius.</i></span>
pleasure what people they were whome he so much praiseth: aduertising you hereof by
the way, that as we haue before expressed, none of the Romane writers mentioneth any
thing of the Scots, nor once nameth them, till the Romane empire began to decay, about
the time of the emperor Constantius, father of Constantine the great: so that if they had
béene in this Ile then so famous both in peace and warre, as they are reported by the same
Boetius; maruell might it séeme, that the Romane writers would so passe them ouer with
silence.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tac. lib. annal.</i> 15.</span>
After the death of Claudius the emperor of Rome, Claudius Domitianus Nero succéeded
him in gouernement of the empire. In the seuenth yéere of whose reigne, which was after
the incarnation 53, the Romans receiued a great ouerthrow in Britaine, where neither the lieutenant
A. Didius Gallus (whom in this place Cornelius Tacitus calleth Auitus) could during the
time of his rule doo no more but hold that which was alreadie gotten, beside the building of
certeine castels (as before ye haue heard) neither his successor Verannius, beating and forreieng
the woods, could atchiue anie further enterprise, for he was by death preuented, so
as he could not procéed forward with his purpose touching the warres which he had ment to
haue folowed, whose last words (in his testament expressed) detected him of manifest ambition:
for adding manie things by way of flatterie to content Neros mind, he wished to
haue liued but two yéeres longer, in which space he might haue subdued prouinces vnto his
dominion, meaning therby the whole Ile of Britaine. But this was a Romans brag, sauouring
rather of ambition than of truth or likelihood.</p>

and take aduise by weapon to redresse it against the Romans their enimies.</i></p>


<h3>THE NINTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">P. Suetonius lieutenant.</span>
But now when this great losse chanced to the Romans Paulinus Suetonius did gouerne
here as lieutenant, a man most plentifullie furnished with all gifts of fortune and vertue,
and therewith a right skilfull warrior. This Suetonius therefore wishing to tame such of
<span class="leftnote">Anglesey inuaded.</span>
the Britains as kept out, prepared to assaile the Ile of Anglesey, a countrie full of inhabitants,
and a place of refuge for all outlawes and rebels. He builded certeine brigantins with flat
kéeles to serue for the ebbes and shallow shelues here and there, lieng vncerteinlie in the
straits which he had to passe. The footmen ferried ouer in those vessels, the horssemen
following by the foords, and swimming when they came into the deepe, got likewise to the
shore, where stood in order of battell and huge number of armed men close togither, redie
to beat backe the Romans, and to staie them from comming to land. Amongst the men,
<span class="rightnote">A strange maner of women.</span>
a number of women were also running vp and downe as they had béene out of their wits,
in garments like to wild roges, with their haire hanging downe about their shoulders, and
bearing firebrands in their hands. There was also a companie of their priests or philosophers
<span class="leftnote">The Druids.</span>
called Druides, who with stretched forth hands towards heauen, thundered out curssings
against the Romans in most bitter wise.</p>
<p>
The souldiers were so amazed with the strangenesse of this sight, that (as men benummed
of their lims and senses) they suffred themselues to be wounded and slaine like
senselesse creatures, till by the calling vpon of their generall, and ech one incouraging other
in no wise to feare a sort of mad &amp; distract women, they preassed forward vnder their ensignes,
bearing downe such as stood in their way, and with their owne fire smooldered and
burnt them to ashes.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Anglesey won by the Romans.</span>
To conclude, the Romane lieutenant got possession of the whole Ile, wherein he placed
garisons of men of warre to kéepe the people there in subiection. He also caused their
<span class="leftnote">Woods cut downe.</span>
woods to be cut downe, that were consecrated to their gods, within the which they were accustomed
to sacrifice sush as they tooke prisoners, and by the view of their intrailes, in dismembring
them, to learne of their gods some oracles and such other things as should come
to passe.</p>
<p>
But now in the meane time, whilest Paulinus was abroad about this enterprise, the Britains
began to conferre togither of they great and importable miseries, of their grieuous state of
seruitude, of their iniuries and wrongs, which they dailie susteined: how that by sufferance
they profited nothing, but still were oppressed with more heauie burthens. Ech countrie
<span class="rightnote">Lieutenant &amp; procurator.</span>
in times past had onelie one king to rule them: now had they two, the lieutenant by his
capteins and souldiers spilling their bloud, and the procurator or receiuer (as we may call
him) bereauing them of their goods and substance. The concord or discord betwixt those
that were appointed to rule ouer them, was all alike hurtfull vnto the subiects, the lieutenant
oppressing them by his capteins and men of warre, and the procurator or receiuer by force
and reprochfull demeanours, polling them by insufferable exactions.</p>
<p>
There was nothing frée from the couetous extortion and filthie concupiscence of these
vnsatiable persons, for in these daies (say they) the greatest spoiler is the valiantest man,
and most commonlie our houses are robbed and ransacked by a sort of cowardlie raskals
that haue no knowledge of anie warlike feats at all. Our children are taken from us, we
are forced to go to the musters, and are set foorth to serue in forren parties, as those that
are ignorant which way to spend our liues in the quarell of our owne countrie. What a
number of souldiers haue beene transported ouer from hence to serue in other lands, if a
iust account were taken thereof: The Germans by manhood haue cast (said they) from<span class="page"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>[Page&nbsp;495]</span>
their shoulders the heauie yoke of bondage, and are not defended as we are with the
maine Ocean sea, but onelie with a riuer. Where the Britains haue their countrie, their
wiues and parents, as iust causes of war to fight for: the Romans haue none at all, but a
couetous desire to gaine by rapine, and to satisfie their excessiue lusts.</p>
<p>
They might easilie be compelled to depart the countrie, as Iulius Cesar was, if the Britains
would shew some proofe of the noble prowesse that was euidentlie found in their woorthie
ancestors, and not shrinke or quaile in courage for the misaduenture that should happilie
chance by fighting one battell or two. Greatest force and constancie alwaies remaineth
with those that séek to deliuer themselues from miserie. Now appeared it that the gods
had taken some pitie of the poore Britains, who by their diuine power did withhold the
chiefe capteine of the Romans with his armie, as it were banished in an other Iland. Let
<span class="rightnote">Occasion not be neglected.</span>
vs then (said they) take the oportunitie of time and good occasion offered, and foorthwith
procéed in our businesse: for lesse danger it is manfullie to aduenture, and to go forward
with our purpose, than to be bewraied and taken in these our consultations. Thus hauing
taken aduise togither, and wholie misliking their present state, they determined to take
weapon in hand, and so by force to seeke for reformation.</p>

<h3>THE TENTH CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tac. lib. 14.</i></span>
The Britains indeed were occasioned to doo as they purposed, thorough manie euill
parts practised by the Romans greatlie to their griefs and displeasures. For whereas Prasutagus
<span class="leftnote">Prasutagus.</span>
(who is supposed by Hector Boetius to be Aruiragus, king of the people called
<span class="rightnote">The Oxfordshire and Glocestershire men.</span>
Iceni) had made the emperour and two of his owne daughters his heires, supposing by that
meane to haue his kingdome and familie preserued from all iniurie: it happened quite contrarie
to that his expectation. For his kingdome was spoiled by the Romane capteins, his
<span class="leftnote">Voadicia alias Bunduica.</span>
wife named Voadicia beaten by the souldiers, his daughters rauished, the péeres of the
realme bereft of their goods, and the kings friends made and reputed as bondslaues.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
There was also an other great cause that stirred the Britains to this rebellion, which was
the confiscating of their goods: for whereas Claudius himselfe had pardoned the chiefest
persons of the forfeitures, Decianus Catus the procurator of that Ile mainteined that the
<span class="leftnote">Vsurie.</span>
same ought to be renewed againe. To this an other griefe was added, that where Seneca
had lent to the nobilitie of the Ile, foure hundred sestercies, ech hundred being 500000
pounds starling, or thereabout, vpon great interest, he required the whole summe togither by
great rigor and violence, although he forced them at the first to take this monie to vsurie.</p>
<p>
Also such old souldiers as were placed by waie of a colonie, to inhabit the towne of
Camelodunum, expelled manie of the Britains out of their houses, droue them out of their
possessions and lands, and accounted the Britains as slaues, and as though they had bene
captiue prisoners or bondmen. Besides this, the temple there that was built in honor of
Claudius, as an altar of eternall rule and gouernment, was serued with préests, the which
vnder colour of religion did spoile, consume and deuoure the goods of all men.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, such strange sights and woonders as chanced about the same time, pricked the
Britains the rather forward. For the image of the goddesse Victoria in the temple at
Camelodunum, slipping downe, turned hir backe (as who should saie she gaue place as<span class="page"><a name="page496" id="page496"></a>[Page&nbsp;496]</span>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
vanquished) to the enimies. Also in the hall where the courts of iustice were kept, there
was a maruellous great noise heard, with much laughing, and a sturre in the theatre, with
<span class="leftnote">Strange woonders.</span>
great wéeping and lamentable howling, at such time as it was certeinlie knowne that there
was no creature there to make anie noise. The sea at a spring tide appeared of a bloudie
colour, and when the tide was gone backe, there were séene on the sands the shapes &amp;
<span class="rightnote"><i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
figures of mens bodies. Women also as rauished of their wits, and being as it were in a
furie, prophesied that destruction was at hand, so that the Britains were put greatlie in hope,
and the Romans in feare.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
But those things, whether they chanced by the craft of man, or illusion of the diuell;
or whether they procéeded of some naturall cause, which the common people oftentimes
taketh superstitiouslie, in place of strange woonders signifieng things to follow, we would
let passe, least we might be thought to offend religion; the which teaching all things to be
doone by the prouidence of God, despiseth the vaine predictions of haps to come, if the
order of an historie (saith Polydor Virgil) would so permit, the which requireth all things
to be written in maner as they fall out and come to passe.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tac. li. 15.</i>
Voadicia by Dion Cassius is called Bunuica.</span>
But the Britains were chiefelie mooued to rebellion by the iust complaint of Voadicia, declaring
how vnséemelie she had beene vsed and intreated at the hands of the Romans: and
because she was most earnestlie bent to séeke reuenge of their iniuries, and hated the name
of the Romans most of all other, they chose hir to be capteine (for they in rule and gouvernment
<span class="leftnote">The ancient Britains admitted as well women as men to publike gouernment.</span>
made no difference then of sex, whether they committed the same to man or
woman) and so by a generall conspiracie, the more part of the people hauing also allured
the Essex men vnto rebellion, rose and assembled themselues togither to make warre
against the Romans. There were of them a hundred and twentie thousand got togither in
one armie vnder the leading of the said Voadicia, or Bunduica (as some name hir.)</p>
<p>
She therefore to encourage hir people against the enimies, mounted vp into an high place
raised vp of turfes &amp; sods made for the nonce, out of the which she made a long &amp; verie
pithie oration. Hir mightie tall personage, comelie shape, seuere countenance, and sharpe
voice, with hir long and yellow tresses of heare reaching downe to hir thighes, hir braue
and gorgeous apparell also caused the people to haue hir in great reuerence. She ware a
chaine of gold, great and verie massie, and was clad in a lose kirtle of sundrie colours, and
aloft therevpon she had a thicke Irish mantell: hereto in hir hand (as hir custome was) she
bare a speare, to shew hirselfe the more dreadfull.</p>

<p>
Now Voadicia being prepared (as you heare) set foorth with such maiestie, that she greatlie
incouraged the Britains; vnto whome for their better animating and emboldening, she
vttered this gallant oration in manner and forme following.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The oration of Voadicia.</span>
"I doo suppose (my louers and friends) that there is no man here but dooth well vnderstand
how much libertie and fréedome is to be preferred before thraldome and bondage.
But if there haue bene anie of you so deceiued with the Romane persuasions, that ye did
not for a time see a difference betwéene them, and iudged whether of both is most to be
desired: now I hope that hauing tried what it is to be vnder both, ye will with me reforme<span class="page"><a name="page497" id="page497"></a>[Page&nbsp;497]</span>
your iudgement, and by the harmes alreadie taken, acknowledge your ouersight, and forsake
your former error. Againe, in that a number of you haue rashlie preferred an externall
souereigntie before the customes and lawes of your owne countrie, you doo at this time
(I doubt not) perfectlie vnderstand how much free pouertie is to be preferred before great
riches, wherevnto seruitude is annexed; and much wealth in respect of captiuitie vnder
forren magistrats, wherevpon slauerie attendeth. For what thing (I beséech you) can there
be so vile &amp; grieuous vnto the nature of man, that hath not happened vnto vs, sithens the
time that the Romans haue bene acquainted with this Iland?</p>
<p>
"Are we not all in manner bereaued of our riches &amp; possessions? Doo not we (beside
other things that we giue, and the land that we till for their onelie profit) paie them all
kinds of tributs, yea for our owne carcases? How much better is it to be once aloft and
fortunate in deed, than vnder the forged and false title of libertie, continuallie to paie for
our redemption a fréedome? How much is it more commendable to lose our liues in defense
of our countrie, than to carie about not so much as our heads toll frée, but dailie
oppressed &amp; laden with innumerable exactions? But to what end doo I remember and
speake of these things, since they will not suffer by death to become frée? For what and
how much we paie for them that are dead, there is not one here but he dooth well vnderstand.
Among other nations such as are brought into seruitude, are alwaies by death discharged
of their bondage: onelie to the Romans the dead doo still liue, and all to increaes
their commoditie and gaine.</p>
<p>
"If anie of vs be without monie (as I know not well how and which way we should
come by anie) then are we left naked, &amp; spoiled of that which remaineth in our houses,
&amp; we our selues as men left desolate &amp; dead. How shall we looke for better dealing at
their hands hereafter, that in the beginning deale so vncourteouslie with vs: since there is no
man that taketh so much as a wild beast, but at the first he will cherish it, and with some
gentlenesse win it to familiaritie? But we ourselues (to saie the trueth) are authors of
our owne mischiefe, which suffered them at the first to set foot within our Iland, and did
not by and by driue them backe as we did Cesar, or slue them with our swords when they
were yet farre off, and that the aduenturing hither was dangerous: as we did sometime to
Augustus and Caligula.</p>
<p>
"We therefore that inhabit this Iland, which for the quantitie thereof maie well be called
a maine, although it be inuironed about with the Ocean sea, diuiding vs from other nations,
so that we séeme to liue vpon an other earth, &amp; vnder a seuerall heauen: we, euen we (I
saie) whose name hath béene long kept hid from the wisest of them all, are now contemned
and troden vnder foot, of them who studie nothings else but how to become lords &amp; haue
rule of other men. Wherefore my welbeloued citizens, friendes, and kinsfolkes (for I
thinke we are all of kin, since we were borne and dwell in this Ile, and haue one name
common to vs all) let vs now, euen now (I saie, because we haue not doone it heretofore,
and whilest the remembrance of our ancient libertie remaineth) sticke togither, and performe
that thing which dooth perteine to valiant and hardie courages, to the end we maie
inioie, not onelie the name of libertie, but also freédome it selfe, and thereby leaue our
force and valiant acts for an example to our posteritie: for if we which haue béene liberallie
and in honest maner brought vp, should vtterlie forget our pristinate felicitie: what may
we hope for in those that shall sucéed vs, and are like to be brought vp in miserie and
thraldome?</p>
<p>
"I doo not make rehearsall of these things vnfo you, to the end I would prouoke you
to mislike of this present estate of things (for well I know you abhorre it sufficientlie
alreadie) neither to put you in feare of those things that are likelie to fall hereafter (because
you doo feare and sée them verie well before hand) but to the end I maie giue
you heartie thankes and woorthie commendations, for that of your owne accord and
meanes you determine so well to prouide for things necessarie (thereby to helpe both me
and your selues with willing minds) as men that are nothing in doubt of all the Romane<span class="page"><a name="page498" id="page498"></a>[Page&nbsp;498]</span>

"If you consider the number of your enimies, it is not greater than yours: if you regard
their strength, they are no stronger than you: and all this dooth easilie appéere by
the bassinets, habergeons, &amp; greiues wherewith you be armed; and also by the walls,
ditches and trenches that you haue made for your own defense, to kéepe off their excursions,
who had rather fight with vs a farre off, than cope &amp; deale with vs at hand strokes,
as our custome of the warres and martiall discipline dooth require. Wherefore we doo so
farre exceed them in force, that in mine opinion, our armie is more strong than stone walls,
and one of our targets woorth all the armour that they doo beare vpon them: by meanes
whereof, if the victorie be ours, we shall soone make them captiues: or if we lose the
field, we shall easilie escape the danger.</p>
<p>
"Furthermore, if after the flight we shall indeuour to méet anie where, we haue the
marishes héere beneath to hide vs in, and the hils round about to kéepe them off, so that
by no meanes they shall haue their purpose of vs, whereas they being ouercharged with
heavie armour, shall neither be able to follow, if we flée; nor escape out of our danger, if
they be put to flight: if they happen to breake out at anie time as desirous to make a rode,
they returne by and by to their appointed places, where we maie take them as birds alreadie
in cage. In all which things, as they are farre inferior to vs, so most of all in this, that
they can not indure hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and sunneshine, as we can doo.</p>
<p>
"In their houses also and tents, they make much account of their baked meates, wine,
oile, and abroad of the shadow, that if anie of these doo faile them, they either die foorthwith,
or else in time they languish and consume: whereas to vs euerie hearbe and root
is meat, euerie iuice an oile, all water pleasant wine, and euerie trée an house. Beside this,
there is no place of the land vnknowne to vs, neither yet vnfriendlie to succour vs at néed;
whereas to the Romans they are for the most part vnknowne and altogither dangerous, if
they should stand in néed: we can with ease swim ouer euerie riuer both naked and clad,
which they with their great ships are scarse able to performe. Wherefore with hope and
good lucke let vs set vpon them couragiouslie, and teach them to vnderstand, that since they
are no better than hares and foxes, they attempt a wrong match, when they indeuour to
subdue the grehounds and the woolues." With which words the quéene let an hare go out
of hir lap, as it were thereby to giue prognostication of hir successe, which comming well
to passe, all the companie showted, and cried out vpon such as not long before had doone
such violence to so noble a personage. Presentlie vpon this action, Voadicia calling them
togither againe, procéeded forward with hir praier, which she made before them all, holding
vp hir hands after this manner:</p>
<p>
"I giue thée thanks O Adraste, and call vpon thee thou woman of women, which
reignest not ouer the burthen-bearing Aegyptians, as Nitocris; neither ouer their merchants,
as dooth Semiramis, for these trifles we haue learned latelie of the Romans: neither ouer
the people of Rome, as a little héeretofore Messalina, then Agrippina, and now Nero, who
is called by the name of a man, but is in déed a verie woman, as dooth appéere by his
voice, his harpe, and his womans attire: but I call vpon thee as a goddesse which gouernest
the Britains, that haue learned not to till the field, nor to be handicrafts men, but to lead
their liues in the warres after the best manner: who also as they haue all other things, so
haue they likewise their wiues and children common, whereby the women haue the like
audacitie with the men, and no lesse boldnesse in the warres than they.</p>
<p>
"Therefore sithens I haue obteined a kingdome among such a mightie people, I beséech
thée to grant them victorie, health, and libertie, against these contentious, wicked, and vnsatiable
men (if they maie be called men, which vse warme bathings, delicate fare, hot
wines, swéet oiles, soft beds, fine musicke, and so vnkindlie lusts) who are altogither
giuen to couetousnesse and crueltie, as their dooings doo declare. Let not I beséech thée,
the Neronian or Domitian tyrannie anie more preuaile vpon me, or (to saie truth) vpon
thée, but let them rather serue thée, whose heauie oppression thou hast borne withall a long<span class="page"><a name="page499" id="page499"></a>[Page&nbsp;499]</span>

<i>Queene Voadicia marcheth against the Romans, to whom she giueth a shamefull and
bloudie ouerthrow without anie motion of mercie, dredfull examples of the Britains
crueltie indifferentlie executed without exception of age or sex.</i></p>

<h3>THE TWELFE CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
When Voadicia had made an end of hir praier, she set forward against hir enimies, who
at that time were destitute in déed of their lieutenant Paulinus Suetonius, being as then in
<span class="rightnote"><i>Corn. Tacit.</i> Catus Decianus procurator.</span>
Anglesey (as before ye haue heard.) Wherefore the Romans that were in Camelodunum
sent for aid vnto Catus Decianus the procurator, that is, the emperours agent, treasurer,
or receiuer, for in that citie (although it were inhabited by Romans) there was no great
garrison of able men. Wherevpon the procurator sent them such aid as he thought he
might well spare, which was not past two hundred men, and those not sufficientlie furnished
either with weapon or armour.</p>
<p>
The citie was not compassed with anie rampire or ditch for defense, such as happilie were
priuie to the conspiracie, hauing put into the heads of the Romans that no fortification
néeded: neither were the aged men nor women sent awaie, whereby the yoong able personages
might without trouble of them the better attend to the defense of the citie: but euen
as they had béene in all suertie of peace, and frée from suspicion of anie warre, they were
suddenlie beset with the huge armie of the Britains, and so all went to spoile and fire that
could be found without the inclosure of the temple, into the which the Romane souldiers
(striken with sudden feare by this sudden comming of the enimies) had thronged themselues.
Where being assieged by the Britains, within the space of two daies the place was woonne,
and they that were found within it, slaine euerie mothers sonne.</p>
<p>
After this, the Britains incouraged with this victorie, went to méet with Petus Cerealis
lieutenant of the legion, surnamed the ninth, and boldlie incountering with the same legion,
gaue the Romans the ouerthrow and slue all the footmen, so that Cerealis with much adoo
escaped with his horssemen, and got him backe to the campe, and saued himselfe within
the trenches. Catus the procurator being put in feare with this ouerthrow, and perceiuing
what hatred the Britains bare towards him, hauing with his couetousnesse thus brought the
warre vpon the head of the Romans, got him ouer into Gallia.</p>
<p>
But Suetonius aduertised of these dooings, came backe out of Anglesey, and with maruellous
constancie marched through the middest of his enimies to London, being as then not
greatlie peopled with Romans, though there was a colonie of them, but full of merchants,
and well prouided of vittels: he was in great doubt at his comming thither, whether he
might best staie there as in a place most conuenient, or rather séeke some other more easie
to be defended. At length considering the small number of his men of warre, and remembring
how Cerealis had sped by his too much rashnesse, he thought better with the losing of
one towne to saue the whole, than to put all in danger of irrecouerable losse. And therewith
nothing mooued at the praier &amp; teares of them which besought him of aid and succour,
he departed, and those that would go with him he receiued into his armie, those that
taried behind were oppressed by the enimies: and the like destruction happened to them
of Verolanium, a towne in those daies of great fame, situat néere to the place where the
towne of Saint Albons now standeth.</p>
<p>
The Britains leauing the castels and fortresses vnassaulted, followed their game in spoiling<span class="page"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>[Page&nbsp;500]</span>
of those places which were easie to get, and where great plentie of riches was to be found,
vsing their victorie with such crueltie, that they slue (as the report went) to the number of
<span class="rightnote">80000, saith <i>Dion</i>.</span>
70 thousand Romans, and such as tooke their part in the said places by the Britains thus
woon and conquered. For there was nothing with the Britains but slaughter, fire, gallowes,
and such like, so earnestlie were they set on reuenge. They spared neither age nor sex:
women of great nobilitie and woorthie fame they tooke and hanged vp naked, and cutting
off their paps, sowed them to their mouthes, that they might séeme as if they sucked and
fed on them, and some of their bodies they stretched out in length, and thrust them on
sharpe stakes. All these things they did in great despite whilest they sacrificed in their
temples, and made feasts, namelie in the wood consecrated to the honour of Andates, for so
they called the goddesse of victorie whom they worshipped most reuerentlie.</p>

<hr /><br /><br />

<p>
<i>P. Suetonius the Romane with a fresh power assalteth the Britains, whose armie consisted
as well of women as men: queene Voadicia incourageth hir souldiers, so dooth Suetonius
his warriors, both armies haue a sharpe conflict, the Britains are discomfited and miserablie
slaine, the queene dieth, Penius Posthumus killeth himselfe, the Britains are
persecuted with fire, swoord, and famine, the grudge betweene Cassicianus and Suetonius,
whome Polycletus is sent to reconcile, of his traine, and how the Britains repined at him.</i></p>


<h3>THE <a name="xiij4" id="xiij4"></a>XIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
In this meane time there came ouer to the aid of Suetonius, the legion surnamed the 14,
and other bands of souldiers and men of warre, to the number of ten thousand in the whole,
wherevpon (chieflie bicause vittels began to faile him) he prepared to giue battell to his
enimies, and chose out a plot of ground verie strong within straits, and backed with a wood,
so that the enimies could not assault his campe but on the front: yet by reason of their great
<span class="rightnote">The Britains were at that time 230000 men, (as <i>Dion</i> writeth.)</span>
multitude and hope of victorie conceiued by their late prosperous successe, the Britains
vnder the conduct of quéene Voadicia aduentured to giue battell, hauing their women there
to be witnesses of the victorie, whome they placed in charrets at the vttermost side of their
field.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Corn. Tacit. li. 15 <br />Dion Cassius.</i></span>
Voadicia, or Boudicia (for so we find hir written by some copies, and Bonuica also by
Dion) hauing hir daughters afore hir, being mounted into a charret, as she passed by the
souldiers of ech sundrie countrie, told them "it was a thing accustomed among the Britains
to go to the warres vnder the leading of women; but she was not now come foorth as one
borne of such noble ancestors as she was descended from, to fight for hir kingdome and
riches; but as one of the meaner sort, rather to defend hir lost libertie, and to reuenge hir
selfe of the enimie, for their crueltie shewed in scourging hir like a vagabond, and shamefull
deflouring of hir daughters: for the licentious lust of the Romans was so farre spred and
increased, that they spared neither the bodies of old nor yoong, but were readie most shamefullie
to abuse them, hauing whipped hir naked being an aged woman, and forced hir
daughters to satisfie their filthie concupiscence: but (saith she) the gods are at hand readie to
take iust reuenge.</p>
<p>
"The legion that presumed to incounter with vs is slaine and beaten downe. The residue
kéepe them close within their holds, or else séeke waies how to flée out of the countrie:
they shall not be once able so much as to abide the noise and clamor of so manie thousands
as we are héere assembled, much lesse the force of our great puissance and dreadfull hands.
If ye therefore (said she) would wey and consider with your selues your huge numbers of
men of warre, and the causes why ye haue mooued this warre, ye would surelie determine
either in this battell to die with honour, or else to vanquish the enimie by plaine force, for so<span class="page"><a name="page501" id="page501"></a>[Page&nbsp;501]</span>
(quoth she) I being a woman am fullie resolued, as for you men ye maie (if ye list) liue and
be brought into bondage."</p>
<p>
"Neither did Suetonius ceasse to exhort his people: for though he trusted in their manhood,
yet as he had diuided his armie into three battels, so did he make vnto ech of them a
seuerall oration, willing them not to feare the shrill and vaine menacing threats of the
Britains, sith there was among them more women than men, they hauing no skill in warrelike
discipline, and heereto being naked without furniture of armour, would foorthwith giue
place when they should féele the sharpe points of the Romans weapons, and the force of
them by whom they had so often béene put to flight. In manie legions (saith he) the
number is small of them that win the battell. Their glorie therefore should be the more,
for that they being a small number should win the fame due to the whole armie, if they
would (thronging togither) bestow their weapons fréelie, and with their swoords and
targets preasse forward vpon their enimies, continuing the slaughter without regard to the
spoile, they might assure themselues when the victorie was once atchiued to haue all at
their pleasures."</p>
<p>
Such forwardnesse in the souldiers followed vpon this exhortation of the couragious
generall, that euerie one prepared himselfe so readilie to doo his dutie, and that with such a
shew of skill and experience, that Suetonius hauing conceiued an assured hope of good lucke
to follow, caused the trumpets to sound to the battell. The onset was giuen in the straits,
greatlie to the aduantage of the Romans, being but a handfull in comparison to their enimies.
The fight in the beginning was verie sharpe and cruell, but in the end the Britains being a
let one to another (by reason of the narrownesse of the place) were not able to susteine the
violent force of the Romans their enimies, so that they were constreind to giue backe, and
so being disordered were put to flight, and vtterlie discomfited.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">80000 Britains slaine.</span>
There were slaine of the Britains that day few lesse than 80000 thousand*<span class="leftnote">[*<i>sic</i>]</span>, as Tacitus
writeth. For the straits being stopped with the charrets, staied the flight of the Britains, so
as they could not easilie escape: and the Romans were so set on reuenge, that they spared
neither man nor woman, so that manie were slaine in the battell, manie amongst the charrets,
and a great number at the woods side, which way they made their flight, and manie were
taken prisoners. Those that escaped, would haue fought a new battell, but in the meane
time Voadicia, or Bonuica deceassed of a naturall infirmitie, as Dion Cassius writeth, but
other say that she poisoned hir selfe, and so died, because she would not come into the
hands of hir bloodthirstie enimies. There died of the Romans part in this most notable
battell 400, and about the like number were grieuouslie hurt and most pitifullie wounded.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Penius Posthumous sleieth himselfe.</span>
Penius Posthumous maister of the campe of the second legion, vnderstanding the prosperous
successe of the other Romane capteins, because he had defrauded his legion of the like
glorie, and had refused to obeie the commandements of the generall, contrarie to the vse of
warre, slue himselfe.</p>
<p>
After this all the Romane armie was brought into the field to make an end of the residue
of the warre. And the emperour caused a supplie to be sent out of Germanie being 2000
legionarie souldiers, and 8 bands of aids, with 1000 horssemen, by whose comming the
bands of the ninth legion were supplied with legionarie souldiers, and those bands and wings
of horssemen were appointed to places where they might winter, and such people of the
Britains as were either enimies, or else stood in doubt whether to be friends or enimies in
déed, were persecuted with fire and sword.</p>
<p>
But nothing more afflicted them than famine, for whilest euerie man gaue himselfe to the
warre, and purposed to haue liued vpon the prouision of the Romans and other their enimies,
they applied not themselues to tillage, nor to anie husbanding of the ground, and long it
<span class="rightnote">Julius Cassickinus procurator.</span>
was yer they (being a fierce kind of people) fell to embrace peace, by reason that Iulius
Cassicianus, who was sent into Britaine as successor to Catus, fell at square with Suetonius,
and by his priuat grudge hindered the prosperous successe of publike affaires. He sticked
not to write to Rome, that except an other were sent to succéed in the roome that Suetonius<span class="page"><a name="page502" id="page502"></a>[Page&nbsp;502]</span>
did beare, there would be no end of the warres. Herevpon one Polycletus, which sometime
had béene a bondman, was sent into Britaine, as a commissioner to surueie the state
of the countrie, to reconcile the legat and procurator, &amp; also to pacifie all troubles within
the Ile.</p>
<p>

The port which Polycletus bare was great, for he was furnished with no small traine that
attended vpon him, so that his presence seemed verie dreadfull to the Romans. But the
Britains that were not yet pacified, thought great scorne to see such honorable capteins and
men of warre as the Romans were, to submit themselues to the order of such a one as had
béene a bondslaue.</p>

Silures.</i></p>

<h3>THE XIIIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">PETRONIUS TURPILIANUS LIEUTENANT.</span>
In place of Suetonius, was Petronius Turpilianus (who had latelie béene consull) appointed
to haue gouernance of the armie in Britaine, the which neither troubling the enimie, nor
being of the enimie in anie wise troubled or prouoked, did colour slouthfull rest with the
honest name of peace and quietnesse, and so sat still without exploiting anie notable enterprise.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">TREBELLIUS MAXIMUS LIEUTENANT.</span>
After Turpilianus, Trebellius Maximus was made lieutenant of Britaine, who likewise
with courteous demeanour sought to kéepe the Britains in rest rather than by force to compell
them. And now began the people of the Ile to beare with pleasant faults and flattering
vices, so that the ciuill warres that chanced in those daies after the death of the emperour
Nero at home, might easilie excuse the slouthfulnesse of the Romane lieutenants.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, there rose dissention amongest their men of warre, which being vsed to lie
abroad in the field, could not agrée with the idle life; so that Trebellius Maximus was glad
to hide himselfe from the sight of the souldiers being in an vprore against him, till at length
humbling himselfe vnto them further than became his estate, he gouerned by waie of intreatie,
or rather at their courtesie. And so was the commotion staied without bloudshed, the armie
as it were hauing by couenant obtained to liue licentiouslie, and the capteine suertie to liue
without danger to be murthered.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">VICTIUS VOLANUS LIEUTENAT.</span>
Neither Victius Volanus that succéeded Maximus whilest the time of the ciuill warres as
yet endured, did trouble the Britains, vsing the same slacknesse and slouth that the other
lieutenants had vsed before him, and permitted the like licence to the presumptuous souldiers:
but yet was Volanus innocent as touching himselfe, and not hated for anie notable crime or
vice: so that he purchased fauour, although authoritie wanted.</p>
<p>
But after that the emperour Vsepasianus had subdued his aduersaries, and atteined the imperiall
gouernment, as well ouer Britaine as ouer other parts of the world, there were sent
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cor. Tacitus.</i></span>
hither right noble capteins, with diuers notable bands of souldiers, and Petilius Cerialis being
appointed lieutenant, put the Britains in great feare, by inuading the Brigants the mightiest
nation of all the whole Iland: and fighting manie battels, and some right bloudie with those
people, he subdued a great part of the countrie at the last.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">IULIUS FRONTINUS LIEUTENAT.</span>
After him succéeded as lieutenant of Britaine, one Iulius Frontinus, who vanquished

<p>
¶Thus may you perceiue in what state this Ile stood in the time that Aruiragus reigned in
the same, as is supposed by the best histories of the old Britains: so that it may be thought
that he gouerned rather a part of this land, than the whole, and bare the name of a king,
the Romans not hauing so reduced the countrie into the forme of a prouince, but that the
Britains bare rule in diuerse parts thereof, and that by the permission of the Romans, which
neuerthelesse had their lieutenants and procuratours here, that bare the greatest rule vnder

<h3>THE XV. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">MARIUS. <i>Hector Boetius</i> saith that his Marius was a Romane. 73.</span>
After the decease of Aruiragus, his sonne Marius succeeded him in the estate, and
began his reigne in the yeare of our Lord 73. In the old English chronicle he is fondlie
called Westmer, &amp; was a verie wise man, gouerning the Britains in great prosperitie, honour
and wealth.</p>
<p>
In the time of this mans reigne, the people called Picts inuaded this land, who are iudged
<span class="leftnote">Of these you maie reade more in pag. <br /><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
to be descended of the nation of the Scithians, neare kinsmen to the Goths, both by countrie
and maners, a cruell kind of men and much giuen to the warres. This people with their ringleader
Roderike, or (as some name him) Londorike, entering the Ocean sea after the maner
of rouers, arriued on the coasts of Ireland, where they required of the Scots new seats to
inhabit in: for the Scots which (as some thinke) were also descended of the Scithians, did as
then inhabit in Ireland: but doubting that it should not be for their profit to receiue so warlike
a nation into that Ile, feining as it were a friendship, and excusing the matter by the narrownesse
of the countrie, declared to the Picts, that the Ile of Britaine was not farre from thence,
being a large countrie and a plentifull, and not greatly inhabited: wherefore they counselled
them to go thither, promising vnto them all the aid that might be.</p>
<p>
The Picts more desirous of spoile than of rule or gouernment without delaie returned to
the sea, and sailed towards Britaine, where being arriued, they first inuaded the north
parts thereof, and finding there but few inhabiters, they began to wast and forrey the countrie:
whereof when king Marius was aduertised, with all speed he assembled his people, and made
<span class="rightnote">Roderike king of Picts slaine.</span>
towards his enimies, and giuing them battell, obtained the victorie, so that Roderike was
there slaine in the field, and his people vanquished.</p>
<p>
Vnto those that escaped with life, Marius granted licence that they might inhabit in the
north part of Scotland called Catnesse, being as then a countrie in maner desolate without
habitation: wherevpon they withdrew thither, and setled themselues in those parties. And
bicause the Britains disdained to grant vnto them their daughters in mariage, they sent vnto
the Scots into Ireland, requiring to haue wiues of their nation. The Scots agréed to their
request, with this condition, that where there wanted lawfull issue of the kings linage to
succéed in the kingdome of the Picts, then should they name one of the womans side to be
their king: which ordinance was receiued and obserued euer after amongst the Picts, so long
as their kingdome endured.</p>
<p>
Thus the Picts next after the Romans were the first of anie strangers that came into this
land to inhabit as most writers affirme, although the Scotish chronicles auouch the Picts to be
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor. Matth. West.</i></span>
inhabiters here before the incarnation of our sauiour. But the victorie which Marius obteined
against their king Roderike, chanced in the yéere after the incarnation 87. In remembrance<span class="page"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>[Page&nbsp;504]</span>
of which victorie, Marius caused a stone to be erected in the same place where
the battell was fought, in which stone was grauen these words, <i>Marij victoria</i>. The English
chronicle saith that this stone was set vp on Stanesmoore, and that the whole countrie
thereabout taking name of this Marius, was Westmaria, now called Westmerland.</p>
<p>
King Marius hauing thus subdued his enimies, and escaped the danger of their dreadfull
inuasion, gaue his mind to the good gouernement of his people, and the aduancement of the
common wealth of the realme, continuing the residue of his life in great tranquillitie, and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matt. West.</i> Thus find we in the British and English histories touching this Marius.</span>
finallie departed this life, after he had reigned (as most writers say) 52, or 53 yéeres. Howbeit
there be that write, that he died in the yéere of our Lord 78, and so reigned not past
fiue or six yéeres at the most. He was buried at Caerleill, leauing a sonne behind him
called Coill.</p>
<p>
Humfrey Lhoyd séemeth to take this man and his father Aruiragus to be all one person,
whether mooued thereto by some catalog of kings which he saw, or otherwise, I cannot
affirme: but speaking of the time when the Picts and Scots should first come to settle themselues
in this land, he hath these words; Neither was there anie writers of name, that made
mention either of Scots or Picts before Vespasianus time, about the yeere of the incarnation
72: at what time Meurig or Maw, or Aruiragus reigned in Britaine, in which time our
annales doo report, that a certeine kind of people liuing by pirasie and rouing on the sea,
came foorth of Sueden, or Norwaie, vnder the guiding of one Rhithercus, who landed in
Albania, wasting all the countrie with robbing and spoiling so farre as Caerleill, where he
was vanquished in battell, and slaine by Muragus, with a great part of his people; the residue
that escaped by flight, fled to their ships, and so conueied themselues into the Iles of
Orkney and Scotland, where they abode quietlie a great while after.</p>
<p>
Thus farre haue I thought good to shew of the foresaid Lhoyds booke, for that it seemeth
to carie a great likelihood of truth with it, for the historie of the Picts, which vndoubtedlie
I thinke were not as yet inhabiting in Britaine, but rather first placing themselues in the Iles
of Orkney, made inuasion into the maine Ile of Britaine afterwards, as occasion was offred.
In the British toong they are called Pightiaid, that is Pightians, and so likewise were they
called in the Scotish, and in their owne toong. Now will we shew what chanced in this
Ile, during the time of the foresaid Marius his supposed reigne, as is found in the Romane
histories.</p>

<h3>THE 16. CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
After Iulius Frontinus, the emperor Vespasian sent Iulius Agricola to succéed in the
<span class="rightnote">Iulius Agricola lieutenant.</span>
gouernement of Britaine, who comming ouer about the midst of summer, found the men
of warre thorough want of a lieutenant negligent inough, so those that looking for no trouble,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Cor. Tacit. in uit. Agr.</i></span>
thought themselues out of all danger, where the enimies neuerthelesse watched vpon the
<span class="rightnote">The first yéere of Agricola his gouernment.</span>
next occasion to worke some displeasure, and were readie on ech hand to mooue rebellion,
For the people called Ordouices, that inhabited in the countrie of Chesshire, Lancashire and
part of Shropshire, had latelie before ouerthrowne, and in maner vtterlie destroied a wing
of such horssemen as soiourned in their parties, by reason whereof all the prouince was
brought almost into an assured hope to recouer libertie.</p>
<p>
Agricola vpon his comming ouer, though summer was now halfe past, and that the souldiers
lodging here &amp; there abroad in the countrie, were more disposed to take rest, than to set<span class="page"><a name="page505" id="page505"></a>[Page&nbsp;505]</span>
forward into the field against the enimies, determined yet to resist the present danger: and
therewith assembling the men of warre of the Romans, and such other aids as he might
make, he inuaded their countrie that had done this foresaid displeasure, and slue the most
part of all the inhabitants thereof. Not thus contented (for that he thought good to follow the
steps of fauourable fortune, and knowing that as the begining proued, so would the whole
sequele of his affaires by likelihood come to passe) he purposed to make a full conquest of
<span class="rightnote">The Ile of Anglesey.</span>
the Ile of Anglesey, from the conquest wherof the Romane lieutenant Paulinus was called
backe by the rebellion of other of the Britains, as before ye haue heard.</p>
<p>
But whereas he wanted ships for the furnishing of his enterprise, his wit and policie found
a shift to supplie that defect: for choosing out a piked number of such Britains as he had
there with him in aid, which knew the foords and shallow places of the streames there, and
withall were verie skilfull in swimming (as the maner of the countrie then was) he appointed
them to passe ouer on the sudden into the Ile, onelie with their horsses, armor, and weapon:
which enterprise they so spéedilie, and with so good successe atchiued, that the inhabitants
much amazed with that dooing (which looked for a nauie of ships to haue transported ouer
their enimies by sea, and therefore watched on the coast) began to thinke that nothing was
able to be defended against such kind of warriors that got ouer into the Ile after such sort
and maner.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Anglesey yéelded to Agricola.</span>
And therefore making sute for peace, they deliuered the Ile into the hands of Agricola,
whose fame by these victories dailie much increased, as of one that tooke pleasure in trauell,
and attempting to atchiue dangerous enterprises, in stead whereof his predecessors had delighted,
to shew the maiesties of their office by vaine brags, statelie ports, and ambitious
pomps. For Agricola turned not the prosperous successe of his procéedings into vanitie, but
rather with neglecting his fame, increased it to the vttermost, among them that iudged what
hope was to be looked for of things by him to be atchiued, which with silence kept secret
these his so woorthie dooings.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, perceiuing the nature of the people in this Ile of Britaine, and sufficientlie
taught by other mens example, that armor should little auaile where iniuries followed to the
<span class="rightnote">Agricola his good gouernment.</span>
disquieting of the people, he thought best to take away and remooue all occasions of warre.
And first beginning with himselfe and his souldiers, tooke order for a reformation to be had
in his owne houshold, yéelding nothing to fauor, but altogither in respect of vertue, accounting
them most faithfull which therein most excelled. He sought to know all things, but not to
doo otherwise than reason mooued, pardoning small faults, and sharpelie punishing great
and heinous offenses, neither yet deliting alwaies in punishment, but oftentimes in repentance
of the offendor. Exactions and tributes he lessened, qualifieng the same by reasonable
equitie. And thus in reforming the state of things, he wan him great praise in time of
peace, the which either by negligence or sufferance of the former lieutenants, was euer
feared, and accounted woorse than open warre. This was his practise in the winter time of
his first yéere.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">His diligence.</span>
But when summer was come, he assembled his armie, and leading foorth the same, trained
his souldiers in all honest warlike discipline, commending the good, and reforming the bad
and vnrulie. He himselfe to giue example, tooke vpon him all dangers that came to hand,
and suffered not the enimies to liue in rest, but wasted their countries with sudden inuasions.
And when he had sufficientlie chastised them, and put them in feare by such manner of dealing,
he spared them, that they might againe conceiue some hope of peace. By which meanes
manie countries which vnto those daies had kept themselues out of bondage, laid rancor
aside, and deliuered pledges, and further were contented to suffer castels to be builded within
them, and to be kept with garrisons, so that no part of Britaine was frée from the Romane
power, but stood still in danger to be brought vnder more and more.</p>
<p><span class="rightnote">The woorthie practises of Agricola to traine the Britains to ciuilitie.</span>
<span class="leftnote">The second yéere of Agricola his gouernment.</span>
In the winter following, Agricola tooke paines to reduce the Britains from their rude
manners and customs, vnto a more ciuill sort and trade of liuing, that changing their naturall
fiercenesse and apt disposition to warre, they might through tasting pleasures be so inured<span class="page"><a name="page506" id="page506"></a>[Page&nbsp;506]</span>
therewith, that they should desire to liue in rest and quietnesse: and therefore he exhorted
them priuilie, and holpe them publikelie to build temples, common halls where plées of
law might be kept, and other houses, commending them that were diligent in such dooings,
and blaming them that were negligent, so that of necessitie they were driuen to striue who
should preuent ech other in ciuilitie. He also procured that noble mens sonnes should learne
the liberall sciences, and praised the nature of the Britains more than the people of Gallia,
bicause they studied to atteine to the knowledge of the Romane eloquence. By which
meanes the Britains in short time were brought to the vse of good and commendable manners,
and sorted themselues to go in comelie apparell after the Romane fashion, and by little and
little fell to accustome themselues to fine fare and delicate pleasures, the readie prouokers of
vices, as to walke in galleries, to wash themselues in bathes, to vse banketting, and such
like, which amongst the vnskilfull was called humanitie or courtesie, but in verie deed it
might be accounted a part of thraldome and seruitude, namelie being too excessiuelie vsed.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The third yéere.</span>
In the third yéere of Agricola his gouernment in Britaine, he inuaded the north parts
thereof (vnknowne till those daies of the Romans) being the same where the Scots now inhabit:
<span class="leftnote">The water of Tay.</span>
for he wasted the countrie vnto the water of Tay, in such wise putting the inhabitants
in feare, that they durst not once set vpon his armie, though it were so that the same was
verie sore disquieted and vexed by tempest and rage of weather. Wherevpon finding no
great let or hinderance by the enimies, he builded certeine castels and fortresses, which he
placed in such conuenient stéeds, that they greatlie annoied his aduersaries, and were so able
to be defended, that there was none of those castels which he builded, either woon by force
out of the Romans hands, or giuen ouer by composition, for feare to be taken: so that the
same beeing furnished with competent numbers of men of warre, were safelie kept from the
enimies, the which were dailie vexed by the often issues made foorth by the souldiers that laie
thus in garrison within them: so that where in times past the said enimies would recouer their
losses susteined in summer by the winters aduantage, now they were put to the woorse, and
kept backe as well in the winter as in the summer.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The fourth yéere of Agricola his gouernment. Clota Bodotria.</span>
In the fourth summer, after that Agricola was appointed vnto the rule of this land, he
went about to bring vnder subiection those people, the which before time he had by incursions
and forreies sore vexed and disquieted: and therevpon comming to the waters of Clide
and Loughleuen, he built certeine fortresses to defend the passages and entries there, driuing
the enimies beyond the same waters, as it had béene into a new Iland.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The fift yéere.</span>
In the fift summer, Agricola causing his ships to be brought about, and appointing them
to arriue on the north coasts of Scotland, he passed with his armie ouer the riuer of Clide;
and subdued such people as inhabited those further parts of Scotland, which till those daies
had not beene discouered by the Romans. And bicause he thought it should serue well to
purpose, for some conquest to be made of Ireland, if that part of Scotland which bordereth
on the Irish seas might be kept in due obedience, he placed garrisons of souldiers in those
parties, in hope verelie vpon occasion to passe ouer into Ireland, and for the more easie aduancement
of his purpose therein, he interteined with honourable prouision one of the kings
<span class="rightnote">An Irish king expelled out of his countrie.</span>
of Ireland, which by ciuill discord was expelled and driuen out of his countrie. In déed
Agricola perceiued, that with one legion of souldiers, and a small aid of other men of warre
it should be an easie matter to conquer Ireland, and to bring it vnder the dominion of the
Romans: which enterprise he iudged verie necessarie to be exploited, for better kéeping of
the Britains in obedience, if they should sée the iurisdiction of the Romans euerie where extended,
and the libertie of their neighbours suppressed.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The sixt yéere of Agricola his government.</span>
In the sixt summer of Agricola his gouernment, he proceeded in subduing the furthermost
parts of Scotland northwards, causing his nauie to kéepe course against him by the coast as
he marched foorth by land, so that the Britains perceiuing how the secret hauens and créekes
of their countries were now discouered, and that all hope of refuge was in maner cut off
from them, were in maruellous feare. On the other part the Romans were sore troubled
with the rough mounteins and craggie rocks, by the which they were constreined to passe<span class="page"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>[Page&nbsp;507]</span>
beside the dangerous riuers, lakes, woods, streicts, and other combersome waies and passages.</p>
<p>
The danger also of them that were in the ships by sea was not small, by reason of winds
and tempests, and high spring tides, which tossed and turmoiled their vessels verie cruellie:
but by the painfull diligence of them that had béene brought vp and inured with continuall
trauell and hardnesse, all those discommodities were ouercome to their great reioising, when
they met and fell in talke of their passed perils. For oftentimes the armie by land incamped
so by the shore, that those which kept the sea came on land to make merrie in the campe,

with the losse of manie a mans life, and effusion of much bloud.</i></p>

<h3>THE XVIJ. CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Calenderwood.</span>
The Britains that inhabited in those daies about the parts of Calenderwood, perceiuing
in what danger they were to be vtterlie subdued, assembled themselues togither, in purpose
to trie the fortune of battell: whereof Agricola being aduertised, marched foorth with his
armie diuided in three battels, so that the enimies doubting to trie the matter in open field,
espied their time in the night, and with all their whole puissance set vpon one of the Romane
legions, which they knew to be most féeble and weake, trusting by a camisado to distresse
the same: and first sleaing the watch, they entred the campe, where the said legion laie,
and finding the souldiers in great disorder, betwixt sléepe and feare, began the fight euen
within the campe.</p>
<p>
Agricola had knowledge of their purposed intent, and therefore with all speed hasted
foorth to come to the succours of his people, sending first his light horssemen, and certeine
light armed footmen to assaile the enimies on their backs, and shortlie after approched with
his whole puissance, so that the Romane standards beginning to appéere in sight by the
light of the daie that then began to spring, the Britains were sore discouraged, and the
Romans renewing their force, fiercelie preassed vpon them, so that euen in the entrie of the
campe, there was a sore conflict, till at length the Britains were put to flight and chased, so
that if the mareshes and woods had not saued them from the pursute of the Romans, there
had beene an end made of the whole warre euen by that one daies worke. But the Britains
escaping as well as they might, and reputing the victorie to haue chanced not by the
valiancie of the Romane soldiers, but by occasion, and the prudent policie of their capteine,
were nothing abashed with that their present losse, but prepared to put their youth
againe into armour: and therevpon they remooued their wiues and children into safe places,
and then assembling the chiefest gouernours togither, concluded a league amongst themselues,
ech to aid other, confirming their articles with dooing of sacrifice (as the manner
in those daies was.)</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The seuenth yéere.</span>
The same summer, a band of such Dutch or Germaine souldiers as had béene leuied in
Germanie &amp; sent ouer into Britaine to the aid of the Romans, attempted a great and woonderfull
act, in sleaing their capteine, and such other of the Romane souldiers which were
appointed to haue the training and leading of them, as officers and instructors to them in
the feats of warre: and when they had committed that murther, they got into thrée pinesses,
and became rouers on the coasts of Britaine, and incountring with diuerse of the Britains<span class="page"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>[Page&nbsp;508]</span>
that were readie to defend their countrie from spoile, oftentimes they got the vpper hand of
them, and now and then they were chased awaie, insomuch that in the end they were brought
to such extremitie for want of vittels, that they did eate such amongst them as were the
weakest, and after, such as the lot touched, being indifferentlie cast amongst them: and
so being caried about the coasts of Britaine, &amp; losing their vessels through want of skill to
gouerne them, they were reputed for robbers, and therevpon were apprehended, first by
the Suabeners, and shortlie after by the Frizers, the which sold diuerse of them to the
Romans and other, whereby the true vnderstanding of their aduentures came certeinlie to
light.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The eight yéere of Agricola his gouernment.</span>
In summer next following, Agricola with his armie came to the mounteine of Granziben,
where he vnderstood that his enimies were incamped, to the number of 30 thousand and
aboue, and dailie there came to them more companie of the British youth, and such aged
persons also as were lustie and in strength, able to weld weapon and beare armour.
<span class="leftnote">Galgagus whome the Scots name Gald and will néeds haue him a Scotish man.</span>
Amongst the capteins the chiefest was one Galgagus whom the Scotish chronicles name
Gald. This man as chiefteine and head capteine of all the Britains there assembled, made
to them a pithie oration, to incourage them to fight manfullie, and likewise did Agricola to
his people: which being ended, the armies on both sides were put in order of battell.
Agricola placed 8 thousand footmen of strangers which he had there in aid with him in
the midst, appointing thrée thousand horssemen to stand on the sides of them as wings.
The Romane legions stood at their backs in stéed of a bulworke. The Britains were imbattelled
in such order, that their fore ward stood in the plaine ground, and the other on
the side of an hill, as though they had risen on heigth one ranke aboue another. The
<span class="rightnote"><i>Corn. Tacit.</i></span>
midst of the field was couered with their charrets and horssemen. Agricola doubting by the
huge multitude of enimies, least his people should be assailed not onlie afront, but also
vpon euerie side the battels, he caused the ranks so to place themselues, as their battels
might stretch farre further in bredth than otherwise the order of warre required: but he
tooke this to be a good remedie against such inconuenience as might haue followed, if the
enimie by the narrownesse of the fronts of his battels should haue hemmed them in on ech
side.</p>
<p>
This done, and hauing conceiued good hope of victorie, he alighted on foot, and putting
his horsse from him, he stood before the standards as one not caring for anie danger that
might happen. At the first they bestowed their shot and darts fréelie on both sides. The
Britains aswell with constant manhood, as skilfull practise, with broad swords and little
round bucklers auoided and beat from them the arrowes and darts that came from their
enimies, and therewithall paid them home againe with their shot and darts, so that the
Romans were néere hand oppressed therewith, bicause they came so thicke in their faces,
<span class="rightnote">Betaui. Congri.</span>
till at length Agricola caused thrée cohorts of Hollanders, &amp; two of Lukeners to presse
forward, &amp; ioine with them at hand-strokes, so as the matter might come to be tried with
the edge of the swoord, which thing as to them (being inured with that kind of fight) it
stood greatlie with their aduantage, so to the Britains it was verie dangerous, that were to
defend themselues with their mightie huge swoords and small bucklers. Also by reason
their swoords were broad at the ends, and pointlesse, they auailed little to hurt the armed
enimie. Wherevpon when the Hollanders came to ioine with them, they made fowle worke
in sleaing and wounding them in most horrible wise.</p>
<p>
The horssemen also that made resistance they pulled from their horsses, and began to
clime the hill vpon the Britains. The other bands desirous to match their fellowes in helping
<span class="rightnote">Hollanders.</span>
to atchiue the victorie, followed the Hollanders, and beat downe the Britains where
they might approch to them: manie were ouerrun and left halfe dead, and some not once
touched with anie weapon, were likewise ouerpressed, such hast the Romans made to follow
vpon the Britains. Whilest the British horssemen fled, their charets ioined themselues
with their footmen, and restoring the battell, put the Romans in such feare, that they were
at a sudden stay: but the charets being troubled with prease of enimies, &amp; vnéeuennesse of<span class="page"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>[Page&nbsp;509]</span>
the ground, they could not worke their feat to anie purpose, neither had that fight anie
resemblance of a battell of horssemen, when ech one so encumbred other, that they had no
roome to stirre themselues. The charets oftentimes wanting their guiders were caried
awaie with the horsses, that being put in feare with the noise and stur, ran hither and
thither, bearing downe one another, and whomsoeuer else they met withall.</p>
<p>
Now the Britains that kept the top of the hils, and had not yet fought at all, despising
the small number of the Romans, began to come downewards and to cast about, that they
might set vpon the backs of their enimies, in hope so to make an end of the battell, and to
win the victorie: but Agricola doubting no lesse, but that some such thing would come
to passe, had aforehand foreséene the danger, and hauing reserued foure wings of horssemen
for such sudden chances, sent them foorth against those Britains, the which horssemen
with full randon charging vpon them as they rashlie came forwards, quicklie disordered
them and put them all to flight, and so that purposed deuise and policie of the Britains
turned to their owne hinderance. For their horssemen by their capteins appointment trauersing
ouerthwart by the fronts of them that fought, set vpon that battell of the Britains which
they found before them. Then in those open and plaine places a greeuous &amp; heauie sight
it was to behold, how they pursued, wounded, and tooke their enimies: and as they were
aduised of other to slea those that they had before taken, to the end they might ouertake
the other, there was nothing but fléeing, taking, and chasing, slaughter, spilling of bloud,
scattering of weapons, grunting and groning of men and horsses that lay on the ground,
gasping for breath, &amp; readie to die.</p>
<p>
The Britains now and then as they saw their aduantage, namelie when they approched
néere to the woods, gathered themselues togither, and set vpon the Romans as they followed
vnaduisedlie, and further (through ignorance of the places) than stood with their
suertie, insomuch that if Agricola had not prouided remedie, and sent foorth mightie bands
of light armed men both on foot and horssebacke to close in the enimies, and also to beat
the wood, some greater losse would haue followed through too much boldnes of them that
too rashlie pursued vpon the Britains: who when they beheld the Romans thus to follow
them in whole troops and good order of battell, they slipt awaie and tooke them to flight,
ech one seeking to saue himselfe, and kept not togither in plumps as before they had doone.
The night made an end of the chase which the Romans had followed till they were
<span class="rightnote">Ten thousand Britains slaine. Aulus Atticus slaine.</span>
throughlie wearied. There were slaine of the Britains that day 10000, and of the Romans
340, among whom Aulus Atticus a capteine of one of the cohorts or bands of footmen
was one, who being mounted on horssebacke (through his owne too much youthfull courage,
and fierce vnrulines of his horsse) was caried into the middle throng of his enimies, and
there slaine.</p>

for their sonnes, kinsfolkes and friends that were wanting. Manie of them forsooke their

for the preseruation of their countrie and liberties. And certeine it is that some of
them slue their wiues and children, as mooued thereto with a certeine fond regard of pitie
to rid them out of further miserie and danger of thraldome.</p>
<p>
The next day the certeintie of the victorie more plainlie was disclosed, for all was quiet
about, and no noise heard anie where: the houses appeared burning on ech side, and such
as were sent foorth to discouer the countrie into euerie part thereof, saw not a creature
stirring, for all the people were auoided and withdrawne a farre off.</p>
<p>
When Agricola had thus ouerthrowne his enimies in a pitcht field at the mountaine of
Granziben, and that the countrie was quite rid of all appearance of enimies: bicause the
summer of this eight yéere of his gouernement was now almost spent, he brought his armie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hector Boet.</i></span>
into the confines of the Horrestians, which inhabited the countries now called Angus &amp;
<span class="leftnote"><i>Cor. Tacitus.</i></span>
Merne, and there intended to winter, and tooke hostages of the people for assurance of their
loialtie and subiection. This doone, he appointed the admirall of the nauie to saile about
<span class="rightnote">An hauen called Trutulensis, peraduenture Rutupensis.</span>
the Ile, which accordinglie to his commission in that point receiued, luckilie accomplished
his enterprise, and brought the nauie about againe into an hauen called Trutulensis.</p>
<p>
In this meane time, whiles Iulius Agricola was thus occupied in Britaine, both the emperour
Vespasianus, and also his brother Titus that succéeded him, departed this life, and
Domitianus was elected emperor, who hearing of such prosperous successe as Agricola had
against the Britains, did not so much reioise for the thing well doone, as he enuied to consider
what glorie and renowme should redound to Agricola thereby, which he perceiued
should much darken the glasse of his fame, hauing a priuate person vnder him, who in
woorthinesse of noble exploits atchiued, farre excelled his dooings.</p>
<p>
To find remedie therefore herein, he thought not good to vtter his malice as yet, whilest
Agricola remained in Britaine with an armie, which so much fauoured him, and that with
so good cause, sith by his policie and noble conduct the same had obteined so manie victories,
so much honor, and such plentie of spoiles and booties. Wherevpon to dissemble
his intent, he appointed to reuoke him foorth of Britaine, as it were to honor him, not
onelie with deserued triumphs, but also with the lieutenantship of Syria, which as then was
<span class="rightnote">Cneus Trebellius alias Salustius Lucullus as some thinke.</span>
void by the death of Aulius Rufus. Thus Agricola being countermanded home to Rome,
deliuered his prouince vnto his successor Cneus Trebellius, appointed thereto by the emperour
Domitianus, in good quiet and safegard.</p>
<p>
¶ Thus may you sée in what state Britaine stood in the daies of king Marius, of whome
Tacitus maketh no mention at all. Some haue written, that the citie of Chester was builded
by this Marius, though other (as before I haue said) thinke rather that it was the worke of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
Ostorius Scapula their legat. Touching other the dooings of Agricola, in the Scotish
chronicle you maie find more at large set foorth: for that which I haue written héere, is
but to shew what in effect Cornelius Tacitus writeth of that which Agricola did here in
Britaine, without making mention either of Scots or Picts, onelie naming them Britains,
Horrestians, and Calidoneans, who inhabited in those daies a part of this Ile which now
we call Scotland, the originall of which countrie, and the inhabitants of the same, is greatlie
controuersed among writers; diuerse diuerslie descanting therevpon, some fetching their
reason from the etymon of the word which is Gréeke, some from the opening of their ancestors
as they find the same remaining in records; other some from comparing antiquities
togither, and aptlie collecting the truth as néere as they can. But to omit them, and returne
to the continuation of our owne historie.</p>

<h3>THE 19. CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">COILLUS. 125.</span>
Coillus the sonne of Marius was after his fathers deceasse made king of Britaine, in
the yeare of our Lord 125. This Coillus or Coill was brought vp in his youth amongst the
Romans at Rome, where he spent his time not vnprofitablie, but applied himselfe to learning
&amp; seruice in the warres, by reason whereof he was much honored of the Romans, and he
likewise honored and loued them, so that he paied his tribute truelie all the time of his
reigne, and therefore liued in peace and good quiet. He was also a prince of much bountie,
and verie liberall, whereby he obteined great loue both of his nobles and commons. Some
<span class="rightnote">Colchester built.</span>
saie, that he made the towne of Colchester in Essex, but others write, that Coill which
reigned next after Asclepiodotus was the first founder of that towne, but by other it should
séeme to be built long before, being called Camelodunum. Finallie when this Coill had
reigned the space of 54 yeares, he departed this life at Yorke, leauing after him a sonne
named Lucius, which succéeded in the kingdome.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">LUCIUS.</span>
Lucius the sonne of Coillus, whose surname (as saith William Harison) is not extant,
began his reigne ouer the Britains about the yeare of our Lord 180, as Fabian following
the authoritie of Peter Pictauiensis saith, although other writers seeme to disagrée in that
account, as by the same Fabian in the table before his booke partlie appeareth, wherevnto
Matthæus Westmonasteriensis affirmeth, that this Lucius was borne in the yeare of our Lord
115, and was crowned king in the yeare 124, as successor to his father Coillus, which died
the same yeare, being of great age yer the said Lucius was borne. It is noted by antiquaries,
<span class="rightnote">165.</span>
that his entrance was in the 4132 of the world, 916 after the building of Rome,
220 after the comming of Cesar into Britaine, and 165 after Christ, whose accounts I follow
in this treatise.</p>
<p>
This Lucius is highlie renowmed of the writers, for that he was the first king of the Britains
that receiued the faith of Iesus Christ: for being inspired by the spirit of grace and truth,
euen from the beginning of his reigne, he somewhat leaned to the fauoring of Christian
religion, being moued with the manifest miracles which the Christians dailie wrought in
witnesse and proofe of their sound and perfect doctrine. For euen from the daies of Ioseph
of Arimathia and his fellowes, or what other godlie men first taught the Britains the gospell
of our Sauiour there remained amongest the same Britains some christians which ceased
not to teach and preach the word of God most sincerelie vnto them: but yet no king
amongst them openlie professed that religion, till at length this Lucius perceiuing not onelie
some of the Romane lieutenants in Britaine as Trebellius and Pertinax, with others, to haue
submitted themselues to that profession, but also the emperour himselfe to begin to be
fauorable to them that professed it, he tooke occasion by their good example to giue eare
more attentiuelie vnto the gospell, and at length sent vnto Eleutherius bishop of Rome two
learned men of the British nation, Eluane and Meduine, requiring him to send some such
ministers as might instruct him and his people in the true faith more plentifullie, and to
baptise them according to the rules of christian religion.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Fol. 119.</span>
¶ The reuerend father Iohn Iewell, sometime bishop of Salisburie, writeth in his * replie
vnto Hardings answer, that the said Eleutherius, for generall order to be taken in the realme
and churches héere, wrote his aduice to Lucius in maner and forme following. "You<span class="page"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>[Page&nbsp;512]</span>
haue receiued in the kingdome of Britaine, by Gods mercie, both the law and faith of
Christ; ye haue both the new and the old testament, out of the same through Gods grace,
by the aduise of your realme make a law, and by the same through Gods sufferance rule
you your kingdome of Britaine, for in that kingdome you are Gods vicar."</p>
<p>
Herevpon were sent from the said Eleutherius two godlie learned men, the one named
Fugatius, and the other Damianus, the which baptised the king with all his familie and people,
<span class="rightnote">Britaine receiueth the faith.</span>
and therewith remoued the worshipping of idols and false gods, and taught the right
meane and waie how to worship the true and immortall God. There were in those daies
within the bounds of Britaine 28 Flamines, &amp; thrée Archflamines, which were as bishops
and archbishops, or superintendents of the pagan or heathen religion, in whose place (they
being remoued) were instituted 28 bishops &amp; thrée archbishops of the christian religion.
One of the which archbishops held his sée at London, another at Yorke, and the third at
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West.</i></span>
Caerleon Arwiske in Glamorganshire. Vnto the archbishop of London was subiect Cornewall,
and all the middle part of England, euen vnto Humber. To the archbishop of Yorke
all the north parts of Britaine from the riuer of Humber vnto the furthest partes of Scotland.
And to the archbishop of Caerleon was subiect all Wales, within which countrie as
then were seuen bishops, where now there are but foure. The riuer of Seuern in those
daies diuided Wales (then called Cambria) from the other parts of Britaine. Thus Britaine
<span class="rightnote">Iosephus of Arimathia.</span>
partlie by the meanes of Ioseph of Arimathia (of whome ye haue heard before) &amp; partlie
by the wholesome instructions &amp; doctrines of Fugatius and Damianus, was the first of all
other regions that openlie receiued the gospell, and continued most stedfast in that profession,
till the cruell furie of Dioclesian persecuted the same, in such sort, that as well in Britaine
as in all other places of the world, the christian religion was in manner extinguished, and
vtterlie destroied.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> Westminster Church built.</span>
There be that affirme, how this Lucius should build the church of saint Peter at Westminster,
though manie attribute that act vnto Sibert king of the east Saxons, and write
how the place was then ouergrowne with thornes and bushes, and thereof tooke the name,
and was called Thorney. They ad moreouer that Thomas archbishop of London preached,
read, and ministred the sacraments there to such as made resort vnto him. Howbeit by
the tables hanging in the reuestrie of saint Paules at London, and also a table sometime
hanging in saint Peters church in Cornehill, it should séeme that the said church of saint
Peter in Cornehill was the same that Lucius builded. But herein (saith Harison <i>anno mundi</i>
4174) dooth lie a scruple. Sure Cornell might soone be mistaken for Thorney, speciallie in
such old records, as time, age, &amp; euill handling haue oftentimes defaced.</p>
<p>
But howsoeuer the case standeth, truth it is, that Lucius reioising much, in that he had
brought his people to the perfect light and vnderstanding of the true God, that they néeded
not to be deceiued anie longer with the craftie temptations and feigned miracles of wicked
spirits, he abolished all prophane worshippings of false gods, and conuerted all such temples
as had béene dedicated to their seruice, vnto the vse of christian religion: and thus
studieng onlie how to aduance the glorie of the immortall God, and the knowledge of his
word, without seeking the vaine glorie of worldlie triumph, which is got with slaughter and
bloudshed of manie a giltlesse person, he left his kingdome; though not inlarged with
broder dominion than he receiued it, yet greatlie augmented and inriched with quiet rest,
good ordinances, and (that which is more to be estéemed than all the rest) adorned with
Christes religion, and perfectlie instructed with his most holie word and doctrine. He
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor. Fabian. Iohn Hard.</i></span>
reigned (as some write) 21 yeares, though other affirme but twelue yeares. Againe, some
testifie that he reigned 77, others 54, and 43.</p>
<p>
Moreouer here is to be noted, that if he procured the faith of Christ to be planted within
this realme in the time of Eleutherius the Romane bishop, the same chanced in the daies of
the emperour Marcus Aurelius Antonius; and about the time that Lucius Aurelius Commodus
was ioined and made partaker of the empire with his father, which was seuen yéere
after the death of Lucius Aelius, Aurelius Verus, and in the 177 after the birth of our<span class="page"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>[Page&nbsp;513]</span>
Sauiour Iesus Christ, as by some chronologies is easie to be collected. For Eleutherius began
to gouerne the sée of Rome in the yéere 169, according to the opinion of the most diligent
chronographers of our time, and gouerned fiftéene yeeres and thirtéene daies. And yet there
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gal. Mon. Matth. West.</i></span>
are that affirme, how Lucius died at Glocester in the yéere of our Lord 156. Other say that
he died in the yere 201, and other 208. So that the truth of this historie is brought into
doubt by the discord of writers, concerning the time and other circumstances, although they
all agrée that in this kings daies the christian faith was first by publike consent openlie receiued
and professed in this land, which as some affirme, should chance in the twelfe yéere
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor</i>.</span>
of his reigne, and in the yéere of our Lord 177. Other iudge that it came to passe in the
eight yeere of his regiment, and in the yéere of our Lord 188, where other (as before is
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nauclerus.</i></span>
said) alledge that it was in the yéere of the Lord 179. Nauclerus saith, that this happened
<span class="leftnote"><i>Hen. Herf.</i></span>
about the yeare of our Lord 156. And Henricus de Herfordea supposeth, that it was in the
yéere of our Lord 169, and in the nintéenth yéere of the emperor Marcus Antonius Verus;
and after other, about the sixt yéere of the emperor Commodus.</p>
<p>
But to conclude, king Lucius died without issue, by reason whereof after his deceasse the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
Britains fell at variance, which continued about the space of fiftéene yéeres (as Fabian thinketh)
howbeit the old English chronicle affirmeth, that the contention betwixt them remained fiftie
<span class="rightnote"><i>Caxton. <br />Iohn Hard.</i></span>
yéeres, though Harding affirmeth but foure yéeres. And thus much of the Britains, and
their kings Coilus and Lucius. Now it resteth to speake somewhat of the Romans which
gouerned here in the meane while. After that Agricola was called backe to Rome, the
Britains (and namelie those that inhabited beyond Tweed) partlie being weakned of their
former strength, and partlie in consideration of their pledges, which they had deliuered to
the Romans, remained in peace certeine yéeres.</p>

<hr /><br /><br />

<p>
<i>The Britains after the deceasse of Lucius (who died without issue) rebell against the Romans,
the emperor Adrian comming in his owne person into Britaine appeaseth the
broile, they go about to recouer their libertie against the Romans, but are suppressed by
Lollius the Romane lieutenant; the vigilantnesse or wakefulnesie of Marcellus, and his
policie to keepe the souldiers waking, the Britains being ruled by certeine meane gentlemen
of Perhennis appointing doo falselie accuse him to the emperor Commodus, he is
mangled and murthered of his souldiers.</i></p>

<h3>THE <a name="xx4" id="xx4"></a>XX. CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">CNEUS TREBELLIUS LIEUTENANT.</span>
In the meane time the Romane lieutenant Cneus Trebellius that succéeded Iulius Agricola,
could not foresee all things so preciselie but that the souldiers waxing vnrulie by reason
of long rest, fell at variance among themselues, and would not in the end obey the lieutenant,
but disquieted the Britains beyond measure. Wherefore the Britains perceiuing themselues
sore oppressed with intollerable bondage, and that dailie the same incresed, they conspired
togither, vpon hope to recouer libertie, and to defend their countrie by all meanes
possible, and herewith they tooke weapon in hand against the Romans, and boldlie assailed
them: but this they did yet warilie, and so, that they might flie vnto the woods and bogs
for refuge vpon necessitie, according to the maner of their countrie. Herevpon diuers
slaughters were committed on both parties, and all the countrie was now readie to rebell:
whereof when the emperour Adrian was aduertised from Trebellius the lieutenant, with all
conuenient speed he passed ouer into Britaine, and quieted all the Ile, vsing great humanitie
towards the inhabitants; and making small account of that part where the Scots now inhabit,
either bicause of the barrennesse thereof, or for that by reason of the nature of the countrie
he thought it would be hard to be kept vnder subiection, he deuised to diuide it from the <span class="page"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>[Page&nbsp;514]</span>
<span class="rightnote">The wall of Adrian built. <i>Spartianus</i>.</span>
residue of Britaine, and so caused a wall to be made from the mouth of Tine vnto the water
of Eske, which wall contained in length 30 miles.</p>
<p>
After this, the Britains bearing a malicious hatred towards the Romane souldiers, and repining
to be kept vnder the bond of seruitude, eftsoones went about to recouer libertie againe.
<span class="rightnote">Lollius Vrbicus lieutenant.</span>
Whereof aduertisement being giuen, the emperour Pius Antoninus sent ouer Lollius Vrbicus
as lieutenant into Britaine, who by sundrie battels striken, constreined the Britains to remaine
<span class="leftnote"><i>Julius Capitol.</i> An other wall built.</span>
in quiet, and causing those that inhabited in the north parts to remooue further off from the
confines of the Romane prouince, raised another wall beyond that which the emperor Adrian
had made, as is to be supposed, for the more suertie of the Romane subiects against the inuasion
of the enimies. But yet Lollius did not so make an end of the warrs, but that the
Britains shortlie after attempted afresh, either to reduce their state into libertie, or to bring
the same into further danger.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">CALPHURNIUS AGRICOLA. Of the doings of this Calphurnius
in Britaine ye may read more in the Scotish chronicle. <i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
Wherevpon Marcus Antonius that succéeded Pius, sent Calphurnius Agricola to succéed
Lollius in the gouernement of Britaine, the which easilie ouercame and subdued all his
enimies. After this there chanced some trouble in the daies of the emperour Commodus
the son of Marcus Antonius and his successor in the empire: for the Britans that dwelled
northwards, beyond Adrians wall, brake through the same, and spoiled a great part of the
countrie, against whom the Romane lieutenant for that time being come foorth, gaue them
battell: but both he and the Romane souldiers that were with him, were beaten downe and slaine.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">Vlpius Marcellus lieutenant.</span>
With which newes Commodus being sore amazed, sent against the Britains one Vlpius
Marcellus, a man of great diligence and temperance, but therewith rough and nothing gentle.
He vsed the same kind of diet that the common souldiers did vse. He was a capteine much
watchfull, as one contented with verie little sléepe, and desirous to haue his souldiers also
vigilant and carefull to kéepe sure watch in the night season. Euerie euening he would
write twelue tables, such as they vsed to make on the lind trée, and deliuering them to one
of his seruants, appointed him to beare them at seuerall houres of the night to sundrie
souldiers, whereby supposing that their generall was still watching and not gone to bed, they
might be in doubt to sléepe.</p>
<p>
And although of nature he could well absteine from sléepe, yet to be the better able to
forbeare it, he vsed a maruellous spare kind of diet: for to the end that he would not fill
himselfe too much with bread, he would eat none but such as was brought to him from
Rome, so that more than necessitie compelled him he could not eat, by reason that the
stalenesse tooke awaie the pleasant tast thereof, and lesse prouoked his appetite. He was a
maruellous contemner of monie, so that bribes might not mooue him to doo otherwise than
dutie required. This Marcellus being of such disposition, sore afflicted the Britains, and put
them oftentimes to great losses: through fame wherof, C&#333;modus enuieng his renowme was
after in mind to make him away, but yet spared him for a further purpose, and suffered him
to depart.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Perhennis capteine of the emperours gard.</span>
After he was remooued from the gouernment of Britaine, one Perhennis capteine of the
emperors gard (or pretorian souldiers as they were then called) bearing all the rule vnder the
emperor Commodus, appointed certeine gentlemen of meane calling to gouerne the armie in
Britaine. Which fond substituting of such petie officers to ouersée and ouerrule the people,
was to them an occasion of hartgrudge, and to him a meanes of finall mischéefe: both which
it is likelie he might haue auoided, had he béene prouident in his deputation. For the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Aelius Lampridius.</i></span>
souldiers in the same armie grudging and repining to be gouerned by men of base degree, in
respect of those that had borne rule ouer them before, being honorable personages, as senators,
and of the consular dignitie, they fell at square among themselues, and about fiftéene
hundred of them departed towards Rome to exhibit their complaint against Perhennis: for
whatsoeuer was amisse, the blame was still laid to him. They passed foorth without impeachment
at all, and comming to Rome, the emperour himselfe came foorth to vnderstand<span class="page"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>[Page&nbsp;515]</span>
what they meant by this their comming in such sort from the place where they were appointed
to serue. Their answer was, that they were come to informe him of the treason which
Perhennis had deuised to his destruction, that he might make his son emperor. To the
which accusation when Commodus too lightlie gaue eare, &amp; beléeued it to be true, namelie,
through the setting on of one Cleander, who hated Perhennis, for that he brideled him from
dooing diuerse vnlawfull acts, which he went about vpon a wilfull mind (without all reason
and modestie) to practise; the matter was so handled in the end, that Perhennis was deliuered
to the souldiers, who cruellie mangled him, and presentlie put him to a pitifull death.</p>

<i>Pertinax is sent as lieutenant into Britaine, he is in danger to be slaine of the souldiers,

land, the one is slaine, the other ruleth.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Pertinax lieutenant of Britaine.</span>
Now will we saie somewhat of the tumults in Britaine. It was thought néedfull to send
some sufficient capteine of autoritie thither; and therefore was one Pertinax that had béene
consull and ruler ouer foure seuerall consular prouinces, appointed by Commodus to go as
lieutenant into that Ile, both for that he was thought a man most méet for such a charge,
and also to satisfie his credit, for that he had béene discharged by Perhennis of bearing anie
rule, and sent home into Liguria where he was borne, and there appointed to remaine. This
Pertinax comming into Britaine, pacified the armie, but not without danger to haue béene
<span class="rightnote">The lieutenant in danger.</span>
slaine by a mutinie raised by one of the legions: for he was stricken downe, and left for
dead among the slaine carcasses. But he woorthilie reuenged himselfe of this iniurie. At
length, hauing chastised the rebels, and brought the Ile into méetelie good quiet, he sued
and obteined to be discharged of that roome, because as he alledged, the souldiers could
not brooke him, for that he kept them in dutifull obedience, by correcting such as offended
the lawes of armes.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">CLODIUS ALBINUS LIEUTENAT.</span>
Then was Clodius Albinus appointed to haue the rule of the Romane armie in Britaine:
whose destruction when Seuerus the emperour sought, Albinus perceiued it quicklie: and
therefore choosing foorth a great power of Britains, passed with the same ouer into France
to encounter with Seuerus, who was come thither towards him, so that néere to the citie of
Lions they ioined in battell and fought right sore, in so much that Seuerus was at point to
haue receiued the ouerthrow by the high prowesse and manhood of the Britains: but yet in
the end Albinus lost the field, and was slaine. Then Heraclitus as lieutenant began to gouerne
Britaine (as writeth Spartianus) being sent thither by Seuerus for that purpose before.
And such was the state of this Ile about the yeare of our Lord 195. In which season, because
that king Lucius was dead, and had left no issue to succéed him, the Britains (as before
ye haue heard) were at variance amongst themselues, and so continued till the comming
of Seuerus, whome the British chronographers affirme to reigne as king in this Ile, &amp; that
by right of succession in bloud, as descended of Androgeus the Britaine, which went to
Rome with Iulius Cesar, as before ye haue heard.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">SEUERUS</span>
This Seuerus as then emperour of Rome, began to rule this Ile (as authors affirme) in the
yeare of our Lord 207, and gouerned the same 4 yeares and od moneths. At length hearing
that one Fulgentius as then a leader of the Picts was entred into the borders of his countrie<span class="page"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>[Page&nbsp;516]</span>
on this side Durham, he raised an host of Britains and Romans, with the which he marched
towards his enimies: and méeting with the said Fulgentius in a place néere vnto Yorke, in
the end after sore fight Seuerus was slaine, when he had ruled this land for the space almost
of fiue yeares, as before is said, and was after buried at Yorke, leauing behind him two sonnes,
the one named Geta, and the other Bassianus. This Bassianus being borne of a British
woman, succéeded his father in the gouernement of Britaine, in the yeare of the incarnation
of our Lord 211. The Romans would haue had Geta created king of Britaine, bearing
more fauour to him because he had a Romane ladie to his mother: but the Britains moued
with the like respect, held with Bassianus. And thervpon warre was raised betwixt the two
brethren, who comming to trie their quarrell by battell, Geta was slaine, and Bassianus with
aid of the Britains remained victor, and so continued king, till at length he was slaine by
one Carausius a Britaine, borne but of low birth, howbeit right valiant in armes, and therefore
well estéemed. In somuch that obteining of the senat of Rome the kéeping of the coasts
of Britaine, that he might defend the same from the malice of strangers, as Picts and others,
he drew to him a great number of souldiers and speciallie of Britains, to whome he promised
that if they would make him king, he would cléerelie deliuer them from the oppression of
the Roman seruitude. Wherevpon the Britains rebelling against Bassianus, ioined themselues
to Carausius, who by their support vanquished and slue the said Bassianus, after he
had reigned 6 or (as some affirme) 30 yeares.</p>

<h3>THE XXIJ CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>
The emperour Seuerus receiuing aduertisment from the lieutenant of Britaine, that the
people there mooued rebellion, &amp; wasted the countrie with roads and forraies, so that it was
néedful to haue the prince himselfe to come thither with a great power to resist the enimies,
he of an ambitious mind reioised not a little for those newes, bicause he saw occasion offered
to aduance his renowne and fame with increase of new victories now in the west, after so
manie triumphs purchased and got by him in the east and north parts of the world. Héerevpon
though he was of great age, yet the desire that he had still to win honour, caused him
to take in hand to make a iournie into this land, and so being furnished of all things necessarie,
he set forwards, being carried for the more part in a litter for his more ease: for that
beside his féeblenesse of age, he was also troubled with the gout. He tooke with him his
<span class="rightnote">Antoninus and Geta.</span>
two sonnes, Antoninus Bassianus and Geta, vpon purpose as was thought, to auoid occasions<span class="page"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>[Page&nbsp;517]</span>
of such inconuenience as he perceiued might grow by discord mooued betwixt them
through flatterers and malicious sycophants, which sought to set them at variance: which
to bring to passe, he perceiued there should want no meane whilest they continued in
Rome, amidst such pleasures &amp; idle pastimes as were dailie there frequented: and therefore
he caused them to attend him in this iournie into Britaine, that they might learne to
liue soberlie, and after the manner of men of warre.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The emperor Seuerus arriueth in Britaine.</span>
Seuerus being thus on his iournie towards Britaine, staied not by the waie, but with all
diligence sped him foorth, and passing the sea verie swiftlie, entred this Ile, and assembled
a mightie power togither, meaning to assaile his enimies, and to pursue the warre against
them to the vttermost. The Britains greatlie amazed with this sudden arriuall of the emperour,
and hearing that such preparation was made against them, sent ambassadours to him
to intreat of peace, and to excuse their rebellious dooings. But Seuerus delaieng time for
answere, as he that was desirous to atchiue some high enterprise against the Britains, for
the which he might deserue the surname of Britannicus, which he greatlie coueted, still was
busie to prepare all things necessarie for the warre; and namelie, caused a great number of
bridges to be made to lay ouer the bogs and mareshes, so that his souldiers might haue place
to stand vpon, and not to be incumbered for lacke of firme ground when they should cope with
their enimies: for the more part of Britaine in those daies (as Herodianus writeth) was full
<span class="leftnote"><i>Herodianus</i>.</span>
of fens &amp; maresh ground, by reason of the often flowings and washings of the sea tides:
<span class="rightnote">He meaneth of the north Britains or sauage Britains as we may call them.</span>
by the which maresh grounds the enimies being thereto accustomed, would run and swim
in the waters, and wade vp to the middle at their pleasure, going for the more part naked,
so that they passed not on the mud and mires, for they knew not the vse or wearing cloths,
but ware hoopes of iron about their middles and necks, esteeming the same as an ornament
token of riches, as other barbarous people did gold.</p>
<p>
Moreouer they marked, or (as it were) painted their bodies in diuerse sorts and with
sundrie shapes and figures of beasts and fowles, and therefore they vsed not to weare anie
garments, that such painting of their bodies might the more apparantlie be séene, which they
estéemed a great brauerie.</p>
<p>
They were as the same Herodianus writeth, a people giuen much to war, and delighted in
<span class="rightnote">The furniture of the sauage Britains.</span>
slaughter and bloudshed, vsing none other weapons or armour but a slender buckler, a
iaueline, and a swoord tied to their naked bodies: as for headpéece or habergeon, they
estéemed not, bicause they thought the same should be an hinderance to them when they
should passe ouer anie maresh, or be driuen to swim anie waters, or flée to the bogs.</p>
<p>
Moreouer, to suffer hunger, cold, and trauell, they were so vsed and inured therewith,
that they would not passe to lie in the bogs and mires couered vp to the chin, without caring
for meate for the space of diuerse daies togither: and in the woods they would liue vpon
roots and barks of trées. Also they vsed to prepare for themselues a certeine kind of meate,
of the which if they receiued but so much as amounted to the quantitie of a beane, they would
thinke themselues satisfied, and féele neither hunger nor thirst. The one halfe of the Ile or
little lesse was subiect vnto the Romans, the other was gouerned of themselues, the people
for the most part hauing the rule in their hands.</p>
<p>
Seuerus therefore meaning to subdue the whole, and vnderstanding their nature, and the
manner of their making warre, prouided him selfe of all things expedient for the annoiance of
them and helpe of his owne souldiers, and appointing his sonne Geta to remaine in that part
of the Ile which was subiect to the Romans, he tooke with him his other sonne Antoninus,
and with his armie marched foorth, and entred into the confines of the enimies, and there
began to waste and forrey the countrie, whereby there insued diuerse conflicts and skirmishes
betwixt the Romans and the inhabitants, the victorie still remaining on the Romans side:
but the enimies easilie escaped without anie great losse vnto the woods, mountains, bogs,
and such other places of refuge as they knew to be at hand, whither the Romans durst not
follow, nor once approch, for feare to be intrapped and inclosed by the Britains that were
readie to returne and assaile their enimies vpon euerie occasion of aduantage that might be<span class="page"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>[Page&nbsp;518]</span>
offered.</p>
<p>
This maner of dealing sore troubled the Romans, and so hindered them in their procéedings,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
that no spéedie end could be made of that warre. The Britains would oftentimes of
purpose laie their cattell, as oxen, kine, shéepe, and such like, in places conuenient, to be
as a stale to the Romans; and when the Romans should make to them to fetch the same
awaie, being distant from the residue of the armie a good space, they would fall vpon them
and distresse them. Beside this, the Romans were much annoied with the vnwholesomnesse
of the waters which they were forced to drinke, and if they chanced to straie abroad, they
were snapped vp by ambushes which the Caledonians laid for them, and when they were so
féeble that they could not through want of strength kéepe pace with their fellowes as they
marched in order of battell, they were slaine by their owne fellowes, least they should be
left behind for a prey to the enimies. Héereby there died in this iournie of the Romane
armie, at the point of fiftie thousand men: but yet would not Seuerus returne, till he had
gone through the whole Ile, and so came to the vttermost parts of all the countrie now called
Scotland, and at last backe againe to the other part of the Ile subiect to the Romans, the inhabitants
whereof are named (by Dion Cassius) <i>Meatæ</i>. But first he forced the other, whom
the same Dion nameth Caledonij, to conclude a league with him, vpon such conditions, as
they were compelled to depart with no small portion of the countrie, and to deliuer vnto
him their armour and weapons.</p>
<p>
In the meane time, the emperour Seuerus being worne with age fell sicke, so that he was
constreined to abide at home within that part of the Ile which obeied the Romans, and to
appoint his sonne Antoninus to take charge of the armie abroad. But Antoninus not regarding
the enimies, attempted little or nothing against them, but sought waies how to win the
fauour of the souldiers and men of warre, that after his fathers death (for which he dailie
looked) he might haue their aid and assistance to be admitted emperour in his place. Now
when he saw that his father bare out his sicknesse longer time than he would haue wished,
he practised with physicians and other of his fathers seruants to dispatch him by one meane
or other.</p>
<p>
Whilest Antoninus thus negligentlie looked to his charge, the Britains began a new rebellion,
not onlie those that were latelie ioined in league with the emperour, but the other also
which were subjects to the Romane empire. Seuerus tooke such displeasure, that he called
togither the souldiers, and commanded them to inuade the countrie, and to kill all such as
they might méet within anie place without respect, and that his cruell commandement he
expressed in these verses taken out of Homer:
<span class="rightnote"><i>Iliados. 3.</i></span></p>

<p class="indent">
Nemo manus fugiat vestras, cædémque cruentam,<br />
Non foetus grauida mater quern gessit in aluo<br />
Horrendam effugiat cædem.
</p>
<p>
But while he was thus disquieted with the rebellion of the Britains, and the disloiall practises
of his sonne Antoninus, which to him were not vnknowne, (for the wicked sonne had
by diuers attempts discouered his traitorous and vnnaturall meanings) at length, rather
<span class="rightnote">Heriodianus. Dion Cassius. Eutropius. <br />Dion Cassius.</span>
through sorrow and griefe, than by force of sicknesse, he wasted awaie, and departed this
life at Yorke, the third daie before the nones of Februarie, after he had gouerned the empire
by the space of 17 yeares, 8 moneths, &amp; 33 daies. He liued 65 yeres, 9 moneths, &amp; 13
daies: he was borne the third ides of April. By that which before is recited out of Herodian
and Dion Cassius, of the maners &amp; vsages of those people, against whome Seuerus held
warre here in Britaine, it maie be coniectured, that they were the Picts, the which possessed
in those daies a great part of Scotland, and with continuall incursions and rodes wasted and
<span class="rightnote">Eutropius. Orosius.</span>
destroyed the borders of those countries which were subiect to the Romans. To kéepe them
backe therefore and to represse their inuasions, Seuerus (as some write) either restored the
<span class="leftnote"><i>Dion Cassius.</i></span>
former wall made by Adrian, or else newlie built an other ouerthwart the Ile, from the east
<span class="rightnote"><i>Beda.</i></span>
sea to the west, conteining in length 232 miles. This wall was not made of stone, but of<span class="page"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>[Page&nbsp;519]</span>
turfe and earth supported with stakes and piles of wood, and defended on the backe with a
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hector Boetius</i></span>
déepe trench or ditch, and also fortified with diuerse towers and turrets built &amp; erected vpon
the same wall or rampire so néere togither, that the sound of trumpets being placed in the
same, might be heard betwixt, and so warning giuen from one to another vpon the first descrieng
of the enimies.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydorus. Herodianus.</i> 211.</span>
Seuerus being departed out of this life in the yere of our Lord 211, his son Antoninus
otherwise called also Bassianus, would faine haue vsurped the whole gouernment into his
owne hands, attempting with bribes and large promises to corrupt the minds of the souldiers:
but when he perceiued that his purpose would not forward as he wished in that behalfe, he
concluded a league with the enimies, and making peace with them, returned backe towards
Yorke, and came to his mother and brother Geta, with whome he tooke order for the buriall
of his father. And first his bodie being burnt (as the maner was) the ashes were put into a
vessell of gold, and so conueied to Rome by the two brethren and the empresse Iulia, who
was mother to Geta the yonger brother, and mother in law to the elder, Antoninus Bassianus,
&amp; by all meanes possible sought to maintaine loue and concord betwixt the brethren, which
now at the first tooke vpon them to rule the empire equallie togither. But the ambition of
Bassianus was such, that finallie vpon desire to haue the whole rule himselfe, he found meanes
to dispatch his brother Geta, breaking one daie into his chamber, and slaieng him euen in his
mothers lap, and so possessed the gouernment alone, till at length he was slaine at Edessa a
citie in Mesopotamia by one of his owne souldiers, as he was about to vntrusse his points to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sextus Aurelius.</i></span>
doo the office of nature, after he had reigned the space of 6 yeares, as is aforesaid. Where
we are to note Gods judgment, prouiding that he which had shed mans bloud, should also

death by Alectus his successor, the Romans foiled by Asclepiodotus duke of Cornewall,
whereof Walbrooke had the name, the couetous practise of Carausius the usurper.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXIIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">CARAUSIUS. 218.</span>
Carausius a Britan of vnknowne birth, as witnesseth the British histories, after he
had vanquisht &amp; slaine Bassianus (as the same histories make mention) was of the Britains
made king and ruler ouer them, in the yeare of our Lord 218, as Galfridus saith: but
<span class="leftnote"><i>Galfrid. Polychron. Fabian.</i></span>
W.H. noteth it to be in the yeare 286. This Carausius either to haue the aid &amp; support of
the Picts, as in the British historic is conteined, either else to be at quietnesse with them,
being not otherwise able to resist them, gaue to them the countries in the south parts of Scotland,
which ioine to England on the east marshes, as Mers, Louthian, and others.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Galfridus.</i></span>
¶ But here is to be noted, that the British writers affirme, that these Picts which were
thus placed in the south parts of Scotland at this time, were brought ouer out of Scithia
by Fulgentius, to aid him against Seuerus, and that after the death of Seuerus, and Fulgentius,
which both died of hurts receiued in the batell fought betwixt them at Yorke:
the Picts tooke part with Bassianus, and at length betraied him in the battell which he
fought against Carausius: for he corrupting them by such subtile practises as he vsed, they
turned to his side, to the ouerthrow and vtter destruction of Bassianus: for the which traitorous
part they had those south countries of Scotland giuen vnto them for their habitation.
But by the Scotish writers it should appeare, that those Picts which aided Fulgentius
and also Carausius, were the same that long before had inhabited the north parts of
Britaine, now called Scotland. But whatsoeuer they were, truth it is (as the British
histories record) that at length one Alectus was sent from Rome by the senat with 3 legions<span class="page"><a name="page520" id="page520"></a>[Page&nbsp;520]</span>
of souldiers to subdue Carausius, which he did, and slue him in the field, as the same histories
make mention, after he had reigned the space of 7, or 8, yeares: and in the yeare of our
saluation two hundred, ninetie, three.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">ALECTUS. Of whom our British histories doo write after their maner. 293.</span>
Alectus in hauing vanquished and slaine Carausius tooke vpon him the rule and gouernment
of Britaine, in the yeare of our Lord 293. This Alectus, when he had restored
the land to the subiection of the Romans, did vse great crueltie against such Britains as had
maintained the part of Carausius, by reason whereof he purchased much euill will of the
Britains, the which at length conspired against him, and purposing to chase the Romans
altogither out of their countrie, they procured one Asclepiodotus (whome the British chronicles
name duke of Cornewall) to take vpon him as chiefe captaine that enterprise. Wherevpon
the same Asclepiodotus assembling a great armie, made such sharpe warres on the
Romans, that they being chased from place to place, at length withdrew to the citie of
London, and there held them till Asclepiodotus came thither, and prouoked Alectus and his
Romans so much, that in the end they issued foorth of the citie, and gaue battell to the
Britans, in the which much people on both parts were slaine, but the greatest number died
on the Romans side: and amongst others, Alectus himselfe was slaine, the residue of the
Romans that were left aliue, retired backe into the citie with a capteine of theirs named
Liuius Gallus, and defended themselues within the walles for a time right valiantlie. Thus
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian. <br />Matth. West.</i></span>
was Alectus slaine of the Britains, after he had reigned (as some suppose) about the terme
of six yeares, or (as some other write) thrée yeares.</p>

<p>
<span class="rightnote">ASCLEPIODOTUS. <i>Gal. Mon. <br />Matt. West.</i></span>
Asclepiodotus, duke of Cornewall, began his reigne ouer the Britains in the yeare of
our Lord 232. After he had vanquished the Romans in battell, as before is recited, he
laid his siege about the citie of London, and finallie by knightlie force entred the same, and
slue the forenamed Liuius Gallus néere vnto a brooke, which in those daies ran through the
citie, &amp; threw him into the same brooke: by reason whereof long after it was called Gallus
<span class="rightnote">Walbrooke.</span>
or Wallus brooke. And at this present the streete where the same brooke did run, is
called Walbrooke.</p>
<p>
Then after Asclepiodotus had ouercome all his enimies, he held this land a certeine space
in good rest and quiet, and ministred iustice vprightlie, in rewarding the good, and punishing
the euill. Till at length, through slanderous toongs of malicious persons, discord was
raised betwixt the king and one Coill or Coilus, that was gouernour of Colchester: the
occasion whereof appeareth not by writers. But whatsoeuer the matter was, there insued
such hatred betwixt them, that on both parts great armies were raised, and meeting in the
<span class="rightnote">Asclepiodotus slaine. <i>Matt. West.</i> hath x. years.</span>
field, they fought a sore and mightie battell, in the which Asclepiodotus was slaine, after he
had reigned 30 yeares. Thus haue Geffrey of Monmouth and our common chroniclers
written of Carausius, Alectus, and Asclepiodotus, which gouerned héere in Britaine.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eutropius</i>.</span>
But Eutropius the famous writer of the Romane histories, in the acts of Dioclesian hath
in effect these woords. "About the same time Carausius, the which being borne of most
base ofspring, attained to high honour and dignitie by order of renowmed chiualrie &amp;
seruice in the warres, receiued charge at Bolein, to kéepe the seas quiet alongst the coasts
of Britaine, France, and Flanders, and other countries thereabouts, bicause the Frenchmen,
which yet inhabited within the bounds of Germanie, and the Saxons sore troubled those
<span class="rightnote">The couetous practising of Carausius.</span>
seas. Carausius taking oftentimes manie of the enimies, neither restored the goods to them
of the countrie from whome the enimies had bereft the same, nor yet sent anie part therof
to the emperours, but kept the whole to his owne use. Whervpon when suspicion arose,
that he should of purpose suffer the enimies to passe by him, till they had taken some prises,
that in their returne with the same he might incounter with them, and take that from them
which they had gotten (by which subtile practise he was thought greatly to haue inriched
him selfe) Maximianus that was fellow in gouernment of the empire with Dioclesianus, remaining
<span class="rightnote">Maximianus purposeth to slea Carusius.</span>
then in Gallia, and aduertised of these dooings, commanded that Carausius should<span class="page"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>[Page&nbsp;521]</span>
be slaine, but he hauing warning thereof rebelled, and vsurping the imperiall ornaments and
title, got possession of Britaine, against whom (being a man of great experience in all warlike
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
knowledge) when warres had béene attempted and folowed in vaine, at length a peace
was concluded with him, and so he enioied the possession of Britaine by the space of seuen
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eutropius.</i></span>
yéeres, &amp; then was slaine by his companion Alectus, the which after him ruled Britaine for
the space of thrée yéeres, and was in the end oppressed by the guile of Asclepiodotus gouernour
of the pretorie, or (as I maie call him) lord lieutenant of some precinct and iurisdiction
perteining to the Romane empire."  And so was Britaine recouered by the foresaid
Asclepiodotus about ten yeeres after that Carausius had first vsurped the gouernment there,
<span class="rightnote">300.</span>
and about the yéere of our Lord 300, as Polydor iudgeth, wherein he varieth much from Fabian
and others.</p>
<p>
¶But to shew what we find further written of the subduing of Alectus, I thinke it not
<span class="rightnote"><i>Mamertinus.</i></span>

and likewise (as ye may perceiue) Constantius who was father to Constantine the

<h3>THE XXIIIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
"All the compasse of the earth (most victorious emperor) being now recouered
through your noble prowesse, not onelie so farre as the limits of the Romane empire had
before extended, but also the enimies borders beeing subdued, when Almaine had beene so
often vanquished, and Sarmatia so often restrained &amp; brought vnder, the people called
<span class="rightnote">Vitungi, Quadi, Carpi, and people of Germanie and Polonie.</span>
Vitungi, Quadi, Carpi so often put to flight, the Goth submitting himselfe, the king of
Persia by offering gifts suing for peace: one despitefull reproch of so mightie an empire
and gouernement ouer the whole greeued vs to the heart, as now at length we will not
sticke to confesse, and to vs it seemed the more intollerable, bicause it onlie remained to the
accomplishing of your perfect renowme and glorie. And verilie as there is but one name
of Britaine, so was the losse to be esteemed smal to the common wealth of a land so plentifull
of corne, so abundant with store of pastures, so flowing with veines of mettall, so gainfull
with reuenues rising of customs and tributes, so enuironed with hauens, so huge in circuit,
the which when Cesar, the founder of this your honourable title, being the first that entered
into it, writ that he had found an other world, supposing it to be so big, that it was
not compassed with the sea, but that rather by resemblance the great Ocean was compassed
with it. Now at that time Britaine was nothing furnished with ships of warre; so that the
Romans, soone after the warres of Carthage and Asia, had latelie beene exercised by sea
against pirats, and afterwards by reason of the warres against Mithridates, were practised as
well to fight by sea as land; besides this, the British nation then alone was accustomed
<span class="rightnote">Picts and Irishmen.</span>
but onelie to the Picts and Irishmen, enimies halfe naked as yet &amp; not vsed to weare armor,
so that the Britains for lacke of skill, easilie gaue place to the Romane puissance, insomuch
that Cesar might by that voiage onelie glorie in this, that he had sailed and passed ouer the
Ocean sea.</p>
<p>
"But in this wicked rebellious robberie, first the nauie that in times past defended the<span class="page"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>[Page&nbsp;522]</span>
coasts of Gallia, was led away by the pirat when he fled his waies: and beside this, a great
number of other ships were built after the mould of ours, the legion of Romane souldiers
was woon, and brought to take part with the enimie, and diuers bands of strangers that
were also souldiers were shut vp in the ships to serue also against vs. The merchants of
the parties of Gallia were assembled and brought togither to the musters, and no small
numbers of barbarous nations procured to come in aid of the rebels, trusting to inrich
themselues by the spoile of the prouinces: and all these were trained in the wars by sea,
through the instruction of the first attemptors of this mischieuous practise.</p>
<p>
"And although our armies were inuincible in force and manhood, yet were they raw
and not accustomed to the seas, so that the fame of a greeuous and great trouble by warre
that was toward by this shamefull rebellious robberie was blowne and sounded in ech mans
<span class="rightnote">Long sufferance of euill increaseth boldnesse in the authors.</span>
eare, although we hoped well of the end. Vnto the enimies forces was added a long sufferance
of their wicked practises without punishment, which had puffed vp the presumptuous
boldnesse of desperate people, that they bragged of our stay, as it had bene for feare of
them, whereas the disaduantage which we had by sea, seemed as it were by a fatall necessitie
to deferre our victorie: neither did they beleeue that the warre was put off for a time
by aduise and counsell, but rather to be omitted through despaire of dooing anie good
against them, insomuch that now the feare of common punishment being laid aside, one of
<span class="rightnote">Carausius slaine.</span>
the mates slue the archpirat or capteine rouer as I may call him, hoping in reward of so great
an exploit, to obteine the whole gouernement into his hands.</p>
<p>
"This warre then being both so necessarie, so hard to enter vpon, so growne in time to a
stubborne stiffenesse, and so well prouided for of the enimies part, you noble emperour did
so take it in hand, that so soone as you bent the thundering force of your imperiall maiestie
against that enimie, ech man made account that the enterprise was alreadie atchiued. For
first of all, to the end that your diuine power being absent, the barbarous nations should
not attempt anie new trouble (a thing chieflie to be foreseene) it was prouided for aforehand
by intercession made vnto your maiestie: for you your selfe, you (I say) mightie lord
Maximian eternall emperour, vouchedsafe to aduance the comming of your diuine excellence
by the neerest way that might be, which to you was not vnknowne. You therefore suddenlie
came to the Rhine, and not with anie armie of horssemen or footmen, but with the
terrour of your presence did preserue and defend all that frontire: for Maximian once
being there vpon the riuage, counteruailed anie the greatest armies that were to be found.
For you (most inuincible emperour) furnishing and arming diuers nauies, made the enimie
so vncerteine of his owne dooing and void of counsell, that then at length he might perceiue
that he was not defended, but rather inclosed with the Ocean sea.</p>
<p>
"Here commeth to mind how pleasant and easefull the good lucke of those princes in
gouerning the common wealth with praise was, which sitting still in Rome had triumphs
<span class="rightnote">Fronto counted Ciceros match.</span>
and surnames appointed them of such nations as their capteins did vanquish. Fronto therefore,
not the second, but match with the first honor of the Romane eloquence, when he
yeelded vnto the emperor Antoninus the renowme of the warre brought to end in Britaine,
although he sitting at home in his palace within the citie, had committed the conduct and
successe of that warre ouer vnto the same Fronto, it was confessed by him, that the emperour
sitting as it were at the helme of the ship, deserued the praise, by giuing of perfect
order to the full accomplishing of the enterprise. But you (most inuincible emperour)
haue bene not onlie the appointer foorth how all this voiage by sea, and prosecuting the
warre by land should bee demeaned, as apperteined to you by vertue of your imperiall
rule and dignitie, but also you haue beene an exhorter and setter forward in the things themselues,
and through example of your assured constancie, the victorie was atchiued. For
you taking the sea at Sluice, did put an irreuocable desire into their hearts that were readie
to take ship at the same time in the mouth of the riuer of Saine, insomuch that when the
capteins of that armie did linger out the time, by reason the seas and aire was troubled, they
cried to haue the sailes hoised vp, and signe giuen to lanch foorth, that they might passe<span class="page"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>[Page&nbsp;523]</span>
forward on their iournie, despising certeine tokens which threatened their wrecke, and so
set forward on a rainie and tempestuous day, sailing with a crosse wind, for no forewind
might serue their turne.</p>
<p>
"But what was he that durst not commit himselfe vnto the sea, were the same neuer so
vnquiet, when you were once vnder saile, and set forward? One voice and exhortation
was among them all (as report hath gone thereof) when they heard that you were once
got forth vpon the water, What doo we dout? what mean we to staie? He is now loosed
from land, he is forward on his waie, and peraduenture is alreadie got ouer: Let vs put
all things in proofe, let vs venter through anie dangers of sea whatsoeuer. What is there
that we may stand in feare of? we follow the emperour. Neither did the opinion of your
good hap deceiue them: for as by report of them selues we doo vnderstand, at that selfe
time there fell such a mist and thicke fog vpon the seas, that the enimies nauie laid at the
Ile of wight watching for their aduersaries, and lurking as it were in await, these your ships
passed by, and were not once perceiued, neither did the enimie then staie although he could
not resist.</p>
<p>
"But now as concerning that the same vnuanquishable army fighting vnder your ensignes
and name, streightwaies after it came to land, set fire on their ships; what mooued them so
to doo, except the admonitions of your diuine motion? Or what other reason persuaded
them to reserue no furtherance for their flight, if need were, nor to feare the doubtfull
chances of war, nor (as the prouerbe saith) to thinke the hazard of martiall dealings to be
common, but that by contemplation of your prosperous hap, it was verie certeine that
there needed no doubt to be cast for victorie to be obteined? There were no sufficient
forces at that present among them, no mightie or puissant strength of the Romans, but
they had onelie consideration of your vnspeakable fortunate successe comming from the
heauens aboue. For whatsoeuer battell dooth chance to be offered, to make full account
<span class="rightnote">The good lucke in a capteine.</span>
of victorie, resteth not so much in the assurance of the souldiers, as in the good lucke
and felicitie of the capteine generall.</p>
<p>
"That same ringleader of the vngratious faction, what ment he to depart from that
shore which he possessed? Why did he forsake both his nauie and the hauen? But that
(most inuincible emperour) he stood in feare of your comming, whose sailes he beheld
readie to approch towards him, how soeuer the matter should fall out, he chose rather to
trie his fortune with your capteins, than to abide the present force of your highnes. Ah
mad man! that vnderstood not, that whither so euer he fled, the power of your diuine
maiestie to be present in all places where your countenance &amp; banners are had in reuerence.
But he fleeing from your presence, fell into the hands of your people, of you was he ouercome,
of your armies was he oppressed.</p>
<p>
"To be short, he was brought into such feare, and as it were still looking behind him,
for doubt of your comming after him, that as one out of his wits and amazed, he wist not
what to doo, he hasted forward to his death, so that he neither set his men in order of
battell, nor marshalled such power as he had about him, but onlie with the old authors of
that conspiracie, and the hired bands of the barbarous nations, as one forgetfull of so great
preparation which he had made, ran headlong forwards to his destruction, insomuch (noble
emperour) your felicitie yeeldeth this good hap to the common wealth, that the victorie being
atchiued in the behalfe of the Romane empire, there almost died not one Romane: for
as I heare, all those fields and hills lay couered with none but onelie with the bodies of
most wicked enimies, the same being of the barbarous nations, or at the leastwise apparelled
in the counterfet shapes of barbarous garments, glistering with their long yellow haires,
but now with gashes of wounds and bloud all deformed, and lieng in sundrie manners, as
the pangs of death occasioned by their wounds had caused them to stretch foorth or draw
in their maimed lims and mangled parts of their dieng bodies. And among these, the
<span class="rightnote">Alectus found dead.</span>
chiefe ringleader of the theeues was found, who had put off those robes which in his life<span class="page"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>[Page&nbsp;524]</span>
time he had vsurped and dishonoured, so as scarse was he couered with one peece of apparell
<span class="rightnote">He had despoiled himselfe of the imperiall robes, bicause he would not be
knowne if he chanced to be slaine.</span>
whereby he might be knowne, so neere were his words true, vttered at the houre of
his death, which he saw at hand, that he would not haue it vnderstood how he was slaine.</p>
<p>
"Thus verelie (most inuincible emperour) so great a victorie was appointed to you by
consent of the immortall gods ouer all the enimies whome you assailed, but namelie the
slaughter of the Frankeners and those your souldiers also, which (as before I haue said)
<span class="leftnote">Francones slue Franci.</span>
through missing their course by reason of the mist that lay on the seas, were now come
to the citie of London, where they slue downe right in ech part of the same citie, what
multitude soeuer remained of those hired barbarous people, which escaping from the battell,
ment (after they had spoiled the citie) to haue got awaie by flight. But now being thus
slaine by your souldiers, the subiects of your prouince were both preserued from further
danger, and tooke pleasure to behold the slaughter of such cruell enimies. O what a manifold
victorie was this, worthie vndoubtedlie of innumerable triumphes! by which victorie
Britaine is restored to the empire, by which victorie the nation of the Frankeners is vtterlie
destroied, &amp; by which manie other nations found accessaries in the conspiracie of that
wicked practise, are compelled to obedience. To conclude, the seas are purged and brought
to perpetuall quietnesse.</p>
<p>
"Glorie you therefore, inuincible emperour, for that you haue as it were got an other
world, &amp; in restoring to the Romane puissance the glory of conquest by sea, haue added
to the Romane empire an element greater than all the compasse of the earth, that is, the
mightie maine ocean. You haue made an end of the warre (inuincible emperour) that
seemed as present to threaten all prouinces, and might haue spred abroad and burst out in
a flame, euen so largelie as the ocean seas stretch, and the mediterrane gulfs doo reach.
Neither are we ignorant, although through feare of you that infection did fester within the
bowels of Britaine onelie, and proceeded no further, with what furie it would haue aduanced
it selfe else where, if it might haue beene assured of means to haue ranged abroad
so far as it wished. For it was bounded in with no border of mounteine, nor riuer, which
garrisons appointed were garded and defended but euen so as the ships, although we had
your martiall prowes and prosperous fortune redie to releeue vs, &amp; was still at our elbowes
to put vs in feare, so farre as either sea reacheth or wind bloweth.</p>
<p>
"For that incredible boldnesse and vnwoorthie good hap of a few sillie captiues of the
<span class="rightnote">The piracie of the Frankeners called <i>Franci</i> or <i>Francones</i>.</span>
Frankeners in time of the emperour Probus came to our remembrance, which Frankeners
in that season, conueieng awaie certeine vessels from the coasts of Pontus, wasted both
Grecia and Asia, and not without great hurt and damage, ariuing vpon diuers parts of the
shore of Libia, at length tooke the citie of Saragose in Sicile (an hauen towne in times
past highlie renowmed for victories gotten by sea:) &amp; after this passing thorough the
streicts of Giberalterra, came into the Ocean, and so with the fortunate successe of their
rash presumptuous attempt, shewed how nothing is shut vp in safetie from the desperate
boldnesse of pirats, where ships maie come and haue accesse. And so therefore by this
your victorie, not Britaine alone is deliuered from bondage, but vnto all nations is safetie restored,
which might by the vse of the seas come to as great perils in time of warre, as to
gaine of commodities in time of peace.</p>
<p>
"Now Spaine (to let passe the coasts of Gallia) with hir shores almost in sight is in
suertie: now Italie, now Afrike, now all nations euen vnto the fens of Meotis are void of
perpetuall cares. Neither are they lesse ioifull, the feare of danger being taken awaie, which
to feele as yet the necessitie had not brought them: but they reioise so much the more for
this, that both in the guiding of your prouidence, and also furtherance of fortune, so great
a force of rebellion by seamen is calmed, vpon the entring into their borders, and Britaine
it selfe which had giuen harbour to so long a mischiefe, is euidentlie knowne to haue tasted
<span class="leftnote">Britains restored to quietnes.</span>
of your victorie, with hir onelie restitution to quietnesse. Not without good cause therfore
immediatlie, when you hir long wished reuenger and deliuerer were once arriued, your
maiestie was met with great triumph, &amp; the Britains replenished with all inward gladnesse,
<span class="rightnote">The Britains receiue Maximian with great ioy and humblenesse.</span><span class="page"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>[Page&nbsp;525]</span>
came foorth and offered themselues to your presence, with their wiues and children, reuerencing
not onlie your selfe (on whom they set their eies, as on one descended downe to
them from heauen) but also euen the sailes and tackling of that ship which had brought
your diuine presence vnto their coasts: and when you should set foot on land, they were
readie to lie downe at your feet, that you might (as it were) march ouer them, so desirous
were they of you.</p>
<p>
"Neither was it anie maruell if they shewed them selues so ioifull, sith after their
miserable captiuitie so manie yeeres continued, after so long abusing of their wiues, and
filthie bondage of their children, at length yet were they now restored to libertie, at length
made Romans, at length refreshed with the true light of the imperiall rule and gouernement:
for beside the fame of your clemencie and pitie, which was set forth by the report
of all nations, in your countenance (Cesar) they perceiued the tokens of all vertues, in
your face grauitie, in your eies mildnesse, in your ruddie cheekes bashfulnesse, in your
words iustice: all which things as by regard they acknowledged, so with voices of gladnesse
they signified on high. To you they bound themselues by vow, to you they bound their
children: yea and to your children they vowed all the posteritie of their race and ofspring.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Dioclesian and Maximian.</span>
"We trulie (O perpetuall parents and lords of mankind) require this of the immortall

those whom you now bring vp, or shall bring vp hereafter. For what better hap can we
wish to them that shall succeed vs, than to be enioiers of that felicitie which now we our
selues enioy? The Romane common wealth dooth now comprehend in one coniunction of
peace, all whatsoeuer at sundrie times haue belonged to the Romans, and that huge power
which with too great a burden was shroonke downe, and riuen in sunder, is now brought
to ioine againe in the assured ioints of the imperiall gouernment. For there is no part of
the earth nor region vnder heauen, but that either it remaineth quiet through feare, or subdued
by force of armies, or at the lestwise bound by clemencie. And is there anie other
thing else in other parts, which if will and reason should mooue men thereto, that might
be obteined? Beyond the Ocean, what is there more than Britaine, which is so recouered
<span class="rightnote">Nations néere to Britaine obeie the emperours.</span>

(most inuincible princes) which are accounted woorthie of you, and thereof commeth it,
that you may equallie prouide for euerie one, sith you haue the whole in your maiesties

Asia did supplie the desert places of Thracia with inhabitants transported thither,
as afterward (most excellent emperour Maximian) by your appointment, the Frankeners at

by your victories (inuincible Constantius Cesar) whatsoeuer did lie vacant about Amiens,
Beauois, Trois, and Langres, beginneth to florish with inhabitants of sundrie nations: yea
and moreouer that your most obedient citie of Autun, for whose sake I haue a peculiar

(inuincible emperour) almost more than I haue beene able, &amp; not so much as I ought, that

<span class="page"><a name="page526" id="page526"></a>[Page&nbsp;526]</span>
<i>What is to be observed and noted out of the panegyrike oration of Mamertinus afore remembred,
with necessarie collections out of other Antiquaries.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXV CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Now let vs consider what is to be noted out of this part of the foresaid oration.
It should seeme that when the emperour Maximian was sent into Gallia by appointment
taken betwixt him and Dioclesian, after he had quieted things there, he set his mind foorthwith
to reduce Britaine vnder the obedience of the empire, which was at that present kept
vnder subiection of such princes as mainteined their state, by the mightie forces of such
number of ships as they had got togither, furnished with all things necessarie, &amp; namelie of
<span class="rightnote">Franci, or Frankeneres, people of Germanie.</span>
able seamen, as well Britains as strangers, among whome the Frankeners were chiefe, a nation
of Germanie, as then highly renowmed for their puissance by sea, néere to the which they
inhabited, so that there were no rouers comparable to them.</p>
<p>
But because none durst stirre on these our seas for feare of the British fléet that passed
to and fro at pleasure, to the great annoiance of the Romane subiects inhabiting alongst the
coasts of Gallia, Maximian both to recouer againe so wealthie and profitable a land vnto the
obeisance of the empire, as Britaine then was, and also to deliuer the people of Gallia
subiect to the Romans, from danger of being dailie spoiled by those rouers that were mainteined
here in Britaine, he prouided with all diligence such numbers of ships as were thought
requisite for so great an enterprise, and rigging them in sundrie places, tooke order for their
setting forward to his most aduantage for the easie atchiuing of his enterprise. He appointed
to passe himselfe from the coasts of Flanders, at what time other of capteines with
their fleets from other parts should likewise make saile towards Britaine. By this meanes
Alectus that had vsurped the title &amp; dignitie of king or rather emperour ouer the Britains,
knew not where to take héed, but yet vnderstanding of the nauie that was made readie in
the mouth of Saine, he ment by that which maie be coniectured, to intercept that fléet, as
it should come foorth and make saile forwards: and so for that purpose he laie with a great
number of ships about the Ile of Wight.</p>
<p>
But whether Asclepiodotus came ouer with that nauie which was rigged on the coasts of
Flanders, or with some other, I will not presume to affirme either to or fro, because in déed
Mamertinus maketh no expresse mention either of Alectus or Asclepiodotus: but notwithstanding
it is euident by that which is conteined in his oration, that not Maximian, but some
other of his capteins gouerned the armie, which slue Alectus, so that we maie suppose that
Asclepiodotus was chiefteine ouer some number of ships directed by Maximians appointment
to passe ouer into this Ile against the same Alectus: and so maie this, which Mamertinus
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eutropius.</i></span>
writeth, agrée with the truth of that which we doo find in Eutropius.</p>
<p>
Héere is to be remembred, that after Maximians had thus recouered Britaine out of their
hands that vsurped the rule thereof from the Romans, it should séeme that not onelie great
numbers of artificers &amp; other people were conueied ouer into Gallia, there to inhabit and
furnish such cities as were run into decaie, but also a power of warlike youths was transported
thither to defend the countrie from the inuasion of barbarous nations. For we find that in
the daies of this Maximian, the Britains expelling the Neruians out of the citie of Mons in
Henaud, held a castell there, which was called Bretaimons after them, wherevpon the citie
was afterward called Mons, retaining the last syllable onlie, as in such cases it hath often
happened.</p>
<p>
Moreouer this is not to be forgotten, that as Humfrey Lhoyd hath very well noted in his
booke intituled "Fragmenta historiæ Britannicæ," Mamertinus in this parcell of his panegyrike
oration dooth make first mention of the nation of Picts, of all other the ancient Romane
writers: so that not one before his time once nameth Picts or Scots. But now to returne
where we left.</p>

<i>The state of this Iland vnder bloudie Dioclesian the persecuting tyrant, of Alban the first
that suffered martyrdome in Britaine, what miracles were wrought at his death, whereof
Lichfield tooke the name; of Coilus earle of Colchester, whose daughter Helen was
maried to Constantius the emperour, as some authours suppose.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXVJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
After that Britaine was thus recouered by the Romans, Dioclesian and Maximian
ruling the empire, the Iland tasted of the crueltie that Dioclesian exercised against the
christians, in persecuting them with all extremities, continuallie for the space of ten yéeres.
Amongst other, one Alban a citizen of Werlamchester, a towne now bearing his name, was
the first that suffered here in Britaine in this persecution, being conuerted to the faith by the
zealous christian Amphibalus, whom he receiued into his house: insomuch that when there
<span class="rightnote"><i>Beda and Gyldas.</i></span>
came sergeants to séeke for the same Amphibalus, the foresaid Alban to preserue Amphibalus
out of danger, presented himselfe in the apparell of the said Amphibalus, &amp; so being
apprehended in his stead, was brought before the iudge and examined: and for that he refused
to doo sacrifice to the false gods, he was beheaded on the top of an hill ouer against
the towne of Werlamchester aforesaid where afterwards was builded a church and monasterie
in remembrance of his martyrdome, insomuch that the towne there restored, after that Werlamchester
was destroied, tooke name of him, and so is vnto this day called saint Albons.</p>
<p>
It is reported by writers, that diuers miracles were wrought at the time of his death, insomuch
<span class="leftnote"><i>Beda.</i> Sée the booke of acts and monuments set forth by master Fox.</span>
that one which was appointed to doo the execution, was conuerted, and refusing to
doo that office, suffered also with him: but he that tooke vpon him to doo it, reioised
nothing thereat, for his eies fell out of his head downe to the ground, togither with the head
of that holie man which he had then cut off. There were also martyred about the same
time two constant witnesses of Christ his religion, Aaron and Iulius, citizens of Caerleon
<span class="rightnote"><i>Iohn Rossus. Warwicens. in lib. de Wigorniens. epis.</i></span>
Arwiske. Moreouer, a great number of Christians which were assembled togither to heare
the word of life, preached by that vertuous man Amphibalus, were slaine by the wicked
<span class="leftnote">Lichfield whereof it tooke name.</span>
pagans at Lichfield, whereof that towne tooke name, as you would say, The field of dead
corpses.</p>
<p>
To be briefe, this persecution was so great and greeuous, and thereto so vniuersall, that
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gyldas</i>.</span>
in maner the Christian religion was thereby destroied. The faithfull people were slaine,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Ran. Cestren.</i></span>
their bookes burnt, and churches ouerthrowne. It is recorded that in one moneths space
<span class="rightnote"><i>Matth. West. Constantius.</i></span>
in diuers places of the world there were 17000 godlie men and women put to death, for
professing the christian faith in the daies of that tyrant Dioclesian and his fellow Maximian.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote">COELUS. 262.</span>
Coelus earle of Colchester began his dominion ouer the Britains in the yeere of our
Lord 262. This Coelus or Coell ruled the land for a certeine time, so as the Britains were
well content with his gouernement, and liued the longer in rest from inuasion of the Romans,
bicause they were occupied in other places: but finallie they finding time for their
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
purpose, appointed one Constantius to passe ouer into this Ile with an armie, the which Constantius
put Coelus in such dread, that immediatlie vpon his arriuall Coelus sent to him an
ambassage, and concluded a peace with him, couenanting to pay the accustomed tribute,
<span class="leftnote"><i>Gal. Mon.</i> <i>Fabian.</i> <i>Caxton.</i></span>
&amp; gaue to Constantius his daughter in mariage called Helen, a noble ladie and a learned.
Shortlie after king Coell died, when he had reigned (as some write) 27 yeeres or (as other
haue) but 13 yeeres.</p>
<p>
¶ But by the way touching this Coelus, I will not denie, but assuredly such a prince
there was: howbeit that he had a daughter named Helen, whom he maried vnto Constantius
the Romane lieutenant that was after emperor, I leaue that to be decided of the learned.
For if the whole course of the liues, as well of the father and the sonne Constantius and
Constantine, as likewise of the mother Helen, be consideratelie marked from time to time,<span class="page"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>[Page&nbsp;528]</span>
and yeere to yéere, as out of authors both Greeke and Latine the same may be gathered,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Lib. 7. cap. 18.</i></span>
I feare least such doubt maie rise in this matter, that it will be harder to prooue Helen a Britane,
than Constantine to be borne in Bithynia (as Nicephorus auoucheth.) But forsomuch
as I meane not to step from the course of our countrie writers in such points, where the
receiued opinion may séeme to warrant the credit of the historie, I will with other admit both
the mother and sonne to be Britains in the whole discourse of the historie following, as
though I had forgot what in this place I haue said.</p>

in an inne: and some againe write, that she was concubine to Constantius, and not his wife.
<span class="rightnote"><i>Cuspinian.</i></span>
But whatsoeuer she was, it appeareth by the writers of the Romane histories, that Constantius
<span class="leftnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
being the daughters sonne of one Crispus, that was brother to the emperour Claudius, came
into Britaine, and quieted the troubles that were raised by the Britains, and there (as some
write) maried the foresaid Helen, being a woman of an excellent beautie, whom yet [after
he was constreined to forsake, and to marrie Theodora the daughter in law of Herculeus
Maximianus, by whome he had six sonnes, and finallie was created emperour, togither with
the said Galerius Maximianus, at what time Dioclesianus and his fellow Herculeus Maximianus
renounced the rule of the empire, and committed the same vnto them. The empire
was then diuided betwixt them, so that to Constantius the regions of Italie, Affrike,
France Spaine and Britaine were assigned; &amp; to Galerius, Illyricum, Grecia, and all the
east parts. But Constantine being a man void of ambition, was contented to leaue Italie and
Affrike, supposing his charge to be great inough to haue the gouernement in his hands of
France, Spaine, and Britaine (as Eutropius saith.)</p>
<p>
But as touching his reigne ouer the Britains, we haue not to say further than as we find in
our owne writers recorded: as for his gouernement in the empire, it is to be considered, that
first he was admitted to rule as an assistant to Maximian vnder the title of Cesar: and so
from that time if you shall account his reigne, it maie comprehend 11, 12, or 13 yeeres,
yea more or lesse, according to the diuersitie found in writers. Howbeit, if we shall reckon
his reigne from the time onelie that Dioclesian and Maximian resigned their title vnto the
empire, we shall find that he reigned not fullie thrée yéeres. For whereas betwéene the
slaughter of Alectus, and the comming of Constantius, are accounted 8 yéeres and od
moneths, not onelie those eight yéeres, but also some space of time before maie be ascribed
vnto Constantius: for although before his comming ouer into Britaine now this last time
(for he had béene here afore, as it well appéereth) Asclepiodotus gouerning as legat, albeit
vnder Constantius, who had a great portion of the west parts of the empire vnder his regiment,
by the title, as I haue said, of Cesar, yet he was not said to reigne absolutelie till
Dioclesian and Maximian resigned. But now to conclude with the dooings of Constantius,
<span class="rightnote">306.</span>
at length he fell sicke at Yorke, and there died, about the yéere of our Lord 306.</p>

<p>
This is not to be forgotten, that whilest he laie on his death-bed, somewhat before he departed<span class="page"><a name="page529" id="page529"></a>[Page&nbsp;529]</span>
this life, hearing that his sonne Constantine was come, and escaped from the emperours
Dioclesian and Maximian, with whom he remained as a pledge (as after shall be
partlie touched) he receiued him with all ioy, and raising himselfe vp in his bed, in presence
of his other sonnes &amp; counsellours, with a great number of other people and strangers that
were come to visit him, he set the crowne vpon his sonnes head, and adorned him with other
<span class="leftnote"><i>Niceph.</i></span>
imperiall robes and garments, executing as it were him selfe the office of an herald, and
withall spake these woords vnto his said sonne, and to his counsellours there about him:
<span class="rightnote"><i>Tripartit. histo.</i></span>
"Now is my death to me more welcome, and my departure hence more pleasant; I haue
héere a large epitaph and monument of buriall, to wit, mine owne sonne, and one whome
in earth I leaue to be emperour in my place, which by Gods good helpe shall wipe away
the teares of the Christians, and reuenge the crueltie exercised by tyrants. This I reckon
to chance vnto me in stéed of most felicitie."</p>
<p>
After this, turning himselfe to the multitude, he commanded them all to be of good comfort,
meaning those that had not forsaken true vertue and godlinesse in Christ, which Christ
he vndertooke should continue with his sonne Constantine in all enterprises, which in warres
or otherwise he should take in hand. That deuise also is woorthie to be had in memorie,
which he put in practise in his life time, to vnderstand what true and sincere Christians
were remaining in his court. For whereas he had béene first a persecuter, and after was
conuerted, it was a matter easie to persuade the world, that he was no earnest Christian:
and so the policie which he thought to worke, was the sooner brought to passe, which
was this.</p>
<p>
He called togither all his officers and seruants, feining himselfe to choose out such as
would doo sacrifice to diuels, and that those onelie should remaine with him and kéepe their
office, and the rest that refused so to doo, should be thrust out, and banished the court.
Héervpon all the courtiers diuided themselues into companies: and when some offered willinglie
to doo sacrifice, and other some boldlie refused: the emperour marking their dealings,
sharpelie rebuked those which were so readie to dishonour the liuing God, accounting them
as treitours to his diuine maiestie, and not woorthie to remaine within the court gates: but
those that constantlie stood in the profession of the christian faith, he greatlie commended,
as men woorthie to be about a prince: and withall declared, that from thencefoorth they
should be as chiefe counsellours and defenders both of his person and kingdome, estéeming
more of them than of all the treasure he had in his coffers.</p>
<p>
To conclude, he was a graue prince, sober, vpright, courteous and liberall, as he which
kept his mind euer frée from couetous desire of great riches: insomuch that when he should
make anie great feast to his friends, he was not ashamed to borow plate and siluer vessell to
<span class="rightnote"><i>Pomponius Lænis.</i></span>
serue his turne, and to furnish his cupbord for the time, being contented for himselfe to be
serued in cruses &amp; earthen vessels. He was woont to haue this saieng in his mouth, that
better it was that the subiects should haue store of monie and riches, than the prince to kéepe
it close in his treasurie, where it serued to no vse. By such courteous dealing the prouinces
which were in his charge flourished in great wealth and quietnesse. He was a verie wise
<span class="rightnote">He died in the yéere 306. as <i>Matt. West.</i> hath noted, and reigned
over the Britains but 11. yéeres as <i>Galf.</i> saith.</span>
and politike prince in the ordering of all weightie matters, and verie skillfull in the practise
of warres, so that he stood the Romane empire in great stéed, and was therefore highlie beloued
of the souldiers, insomuch that immediatlie after his deceasse, they proclaimed his
sonne Constantine emperour.</p>
<p>
That the Christian faith was imbraced of the Britains in this season, it maie appéere, in
that Hilarias bishop of Poictiers writeth to his brethren in Britaine, and Constantine in an
epistle (as Theodoretus saith in his first booke and tenth chapter) maketh mention of the
churches in Britaine: which also Sozomenus dooth affirme. For the Britains after they had
receiued the faith, defended the same euen with the shedding of their bloud, as Amphibalus,
<span class="rightnote">291. <i>Iohn Bale.</i></span>
who in this Constantius daies being apprehended, suffered at Redburne neere to Werlamchester,
about 15 yéeres after the martyrdome of his host S. Albane.</p>

<h3>THE XXVIIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">CONSTANTINE. 306.</span>
Constantine being the son of the forenamed Constantius, begot of his first wife
Helen, the daughter (as some affirme) of Coell late king of the Britains, began to reigne in
the yéere of our Lord 306. This worthie prince begotten of a British woman, &amp; borne of
hir in Britaine (as our writers doo affirme) and created certeinlie emperour in Britaine, did
doubtlesse make his natiue countrie partaker of his high glorie and renowme, which by his
great prowes, politike wisedome, woorthie gouernment, and other his princelie qualities most
abundantlie planted in his noble person, he purchased and got thorough the circuit of the
whole earth, insomuch that for the high enterprises and noble acts by him happilie brought
to passe and atchiued, he was surnamed (as before is said) the great Constantine. Whilest
this Constantine remained at Rome in manner as he had béene a pledge with Galerius in his
fathers life time, he being then but yoong, fled from thence, and with all post hast returned
to his father into Britaine, killing or howghing by the waie all such horsses as were appointed
<span class="rightnote">Eutropius. Sextus Aurelius Victor.</span>
to stand at innes readie for such as should ride in post, least being pursued, he should haue
béene ouertaken, and brought backe againe by such as might be sent to pursue him.</p>
<p>
At his comming into Britaine, he found his father sore vexed with sicknesse, whereof
shortlie after he died, and then was he by helpe of such as were about him, incouraged to
<span class="rightnote">Erocus king of the Almains.</span>
take vpon him as emperour: and namelie one Erocus king of the Almains, which had accompanied
his father thither, assisted him thereto, so that being proclaimed emperour, he
tooke vpon him the rule of those countries which his father had in gouernment, that is to
saie, France, Spaine, the Alpes, and Britaine, with other prouinces héere in the west: and
ruling the same with great equitie and wisdome, he greatly wan the fauour of the people,
insomuch that the fame of his politike gouernment and courteous dealing being spred abroad,
<span class="rightnote">Maxentius the tyrant.</span>
when Maxentius the tyrant that occupied the rule of the empire at Rome, and in Italie by
wrongfull vsurping &amp; abusing the same, was grown into the hatred of the Romans and other
Italians, Constantine was earnestlie by them requested to come into Italie, and to helpe to
subdue Maxentius, that he might reforme the state of things there.</p>
<p>
This Maxentius was sonne to Herculeus Maximianus, and Constantine had married Fausta
the daughter of the said Maximianus. Now so it was, that Maximianus, immediatlie after
that his sonne Maxentius had taken the rule vpon him, sought meanes to haue deposed him,
and to haue resumed and taken eftsoones into his owne hands the gouernment of the empire.
But solliciting Dioclesian to doo the like, he was much reprooued of him for his vnreasonable
and ambitious purpose: so that when he perceiued that neither Dioclesian would be thereto
agreeable, nor induce the souldiers to admit him, they hauing alreadie established his sonne,
began to deuise waies how to assure the state more stronglie to his said sonne. And hearing
that his sonne in law Constantine was minded to come into Italie against him, he purposed to
practise Constantines destruction, insomuch that it was iudged by this which followed, that
<span class="rightnote">Dissimulation.</span>
Herculeus Maximianus did but for a colour séeme to mislike that which his said son Maxentius
had doone, to the end he might the sooner accomplish his intent for the dispatching of<span class="page"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>[Page&nbsp;531]</span>
Constantine out of the waie.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Ranulphus Cestrensis.</i></span>
Heerevpon (as it were) fléeing out of Italie, he came to Constantine, who as then hauing
appointed lieutenants vnder him in Britaine, remained in France, and with all ioy and honour
that might be, receiued his father in law: the which being earnestlie bent to compasse his
<span class="rightnote">Fausta the daughter of Maximianas and wife to Constantine.</span>
purpose, made his daughter Fausta priuie thereto: which ladie (either for feare least the concealing
thereof might turne hir to displeasure, either else for the entire loue which she bare
to hir husband) reuealed hir fathers wicked purpose. Wherevpon whilest Constantine went
<span class="leftnote">Marsiles.</span>
about to be reuenged of such a traitorous practise, Herculeus fled to Marsiles, purposing there
to take the sea, and so to retire to his sonne Maxentius into Italie. But yer he could get
<span class="rightnote">Maximianus slaine. <i>Ann. Chri. 322.</i></span>
awaie from thence, he was strangled by commandement of his sonne in law Constantine, and
so ended his life, which he had spotted with manie cruell acts, as well in persecuting the professours
of the christian name, as others.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Licinius chosen fellow with Maximianus in the empire.</span>
In this meane time had Maximianus adopted one Licinius to assist him in gouernance of the
empire, proclaiming him Cesar. So that now at one selfe time Constantine gouerned France
and the west parts of the empire, Maxentius held Italie, Affrike, and Aegypt: and Maximianus
which likewise had beene elected Cesar, ruled the east parts, and Licinius Illyrium
and Grecia. But shortlie after, the emperour Constantine ioined in league with Licinius,
and gaue to him his sister in marriage, named Constantia, for more suertie of faithfull
friendship to indure betwixt them. He sent him also against Maximianus who gouerning in
the east part of the empire, purposed the destruction of Constantine and all his partakers:
but being vanquished by Licinius at Tarsus, he shortlie after died, being eaten with lice.
Constantine after this was called into Italie, to deliuer the Romans and Italians from the
tyrannie of Maxentius, which occasion so offered, Constantine gladlie accepting, passed into
Italie, and after certeine victories got against Maxentius, at length slue him.</p>
<p>
After this, when Maximianus was dead, who prepared to make warre against Licinius,
that had married Constantia the sister of Constantine, he finallie made warre against his
brother in law the said Licinius, by reason of such quarrels as fell out betwixt them. In
the which warre Licinius was put to the woorse, and at length comming into the hands of
Constantine, was put to death, so that Constantine by this meanes got the whole empire vnder
his rule and subiection. He was a great fauourer of the Christian religion, insomuch that to
aduance the same, he tooke order for the conuerting of the temples dedicated to the honour
of idols, vnto the seruice of the true and almightie God. He commanded also, that none
<span class="rightnote">Christians honoured and cherished.</span>
should be admitted to serue as a souldier in the warres, except he were a christian, nor yet
to haue rule of anie countrie or armie. He also ordeined, the wéeke before Easter, and
that which followed to be kept as holie, and no person to doo anie bodilie woorks during
the same.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i> The praise of the empresse Helen. 328.</span>
He was much counselled by that noble and most vertuous ladie his mother, the empresse
Helen, who being a godlie and deuout woman, did what in hir laie, to mooue him to the
setting foorth of Gods honour and increase of the christian faith, wherein as yet he was not
fullie instructed. ¶ Some writers alledge, that she being at Ierusalem, made diligent search
to find out the place of the sepulchre of our Lord, and at length found it, though with
much adoo: for the infidels had stopped it vp, and couered it with a heape of filthie earth,
and builded aloft vpon the place, a chappell dedicated to Venus, where yoong women vsed
to sing songs in honour of that vnchast goddesse. Helen caused the same to be ouerthrowne,
the earth to be remooued, and the place cleansed, so that at length the sepulchre appéered,
and fast by were found there buried in the earth thrée crosses and the nailes. But the crosse
wherevpon our Sauiour was crucified, was knowne by the title written vpon it, though almost
worne out, in letters of Hebrew, Gréeke, and Latine: the inscription was this, <i>Iesus Nazarenus
rex Iudæorum.</i> It was also perceiued which was that crosse by a miracle (as it is
reported, but how trulie I can not tell) that should be wrought thereby: for being laid to a
sicke woman, onlie with the touching thereof she was healed. It was also said, that a dead
man was raised from death to life, his bodie onlie being touched therewith. Wherevpon<span class="page"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>[Page&nbsp;532]</span>
Constantine mooued with these things, forbad that from thencefoorth anie should be put to
death on the crosse, to the end that the thing which afore time was accounted infamous and
reprochfull, might now be had in honour and reuerence.</p>
<p>
The empresse Helen hauing thus found the crosse, builded a temple there,&amp; taking with hir
the nailes, returned with the same to hir sonne Constantine, who set one of them in the crest of
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
his helmet, an other in the bridle of his horsse, and the third he cast into the sea, to asswage
and pacifie the furious tempests and rage thereof. She also brought with hir a parcell of that
<span class="leftnote"><i>Polydor.</i></span>
holie crosse, and gaue it to hir sonne the said Constantine, the which he caused to be closed
within an image that represented his person, standing vpon a piller in the market place of
Constantine, or (as some late writers haue) he caused it to be inclosed in a coffer of gold,
adorned with rich stones and pearls, placing it in a church called Sessoriana, the which
church he indued with manie great gifts and precious ornaments. Manie works of great
zeale and vertue are remembered by writers to haue béene doone by this Constantine and his
mother Helen, to the setting foorth of Gods glorie, and the aduancing of the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The commendation of Constantine.</span>
But to be briefe, he was a man in whome manie excellent vertues and good qualities both of
mind and bodie manifestlie appéered, chieflie he was a prince of great knowledge and experience
in warre, and therewith verie fortunate, an earnest louer of iustice, and to conclude,
borne to all honour.</p>
<p>
But now to speake somewhat of the state of Britaine in his time, ye shall vnderstand,
that as before is recorded, at his going ouer into France, after that he was proclaimed emperour,
he left behind him in Britaine certeine gouernours to rule the land, and amongst
other one Maximinus a right valiant capteine. He tooke with him a great part of the youth
of Britaine, and diuerse of the chiefe men amongst the nobilitie, in whose approoued manhood,
loialtie, and constancie, he conceiued a great hope to go thorough with all his enterprises,
as with the which being accompanied and compassed about, he passed ouer into Gallia,
entred into Italie, and in euerie place ouercame his enimies.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gulielmus Malmes.</i> Britains seruing in the warres vnder Constantine.</span>
Some write that Constantine thus conueieng ouer sea with him a great armie of Britains,
and by their industrie obteining victorie as he wished, he placed a great number of such as
were discharged out of wages, and licenced to giue ouer the warre, in a part of Gallia
towards the west sea coast, where their posteritie remaine vnto this daie, maruellouslie increased
afterwards, and somewhat differing from our Britains, the Welshmen, in manners
and language. Amongst those noble men which he tooke with him when he departed out
<span class="rightnote"><i>Galfridus. Matt. West.</i></span>
of this land (as our writers doo testifie) were thrée vncles of his mother Helen, that is to

<h3>THE XXIX CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
Now in the meane time that Constantine had obteined and ruled the whole empire,
Britaine as it were hauing recouered libertie, in that one of hir children being hir king, had
<span class="rightnote">Octauius. <i>Caxton.</i> Gewisses inhabited the countrie which the west Saxons after held.
The name of Gewisses came in with the Saxons of Guuy, &amp;c.</span>
got the gouernment of the whole earth, remained in better quiet than afore time she had<span class="page"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>[Page&nbsp;533]</span>
doone. But yet in the meane season, if we shall credit the British chronicle and Geffrey of
Monmouth the interpretor thereof; there was a British lord, named Octauius or Octauian,
as the old English chronicle nameth him, that was duke of the Gewisses, and appointed by
Constantine to be ruler of the land in his absence, the which Octauius (after that Constantine
had recouered Rome and Italie, and was so busied in the affaires of the empire in those parts,
that as was thought, he could not returne backe into Britaine) seized into his hands the whole
dominion of Britaine, and held himselfe for king.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">OCTAUIUS. <i>Galfridus</i>.329.</span>
This Octauius then beginning his reigne ouer the Britains in the yéere of our Lord 329,

prouoked Constantine to send against him one of his mothers vncles, the foresaid Traherne.
This Trahernus, or as some name him Traherne, entred this land with three legions of souldiers,
&amp; in a field néere vnto Winchester, was incountered by Octauius and his Britains, by
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian</i>. <i>Galfridus</i>. This agréeth not altogither with that which
<i>Hector Boetius</i> writeth, as in the Scotish chronicle appéereth.</span>
whome after a sore battell there striken betwixt them, in the end Traherne was put to flight
and chased, insomuch that he was constreined to forsake that part of the land, and to draw
towards Scotland. Octauius hauing knowledge of his passage, followed him, &amp; in the countrie
of Westmerland eftsoones gaue him battell, but in that battell Octauius was put to the woorsse,
and constreined to forsake the land, fled into Norway, there to purchase aid: and being readie
with such power as he there gathered, what of Britains and Norwegians, to returne into
Britaine. Before his landing he was aduertised that an earle of Britaine which bare him
<span class="leftnote">Traherne slaine. See in the Scotish chronicles more of these matters. <i>Matth. West.</i> saith 316.</span>
heartie good will, had by treason slaine Traherne. Octauius then comming to land, eftsoones
got possession of Britaine, which should be (as Fabian gathereth) about the yéere of our
Lord 329, in the 20 yéere of the reigne of the emperour Constantine, and about two yéeres
after that the said Octauius first tooke vpon him to rule as king. </p>
<p>
After this (as the British chronicle affirmeth) Octauius gouerned the land right noblie, and
greatlie to the contentation of the Britains. At length when he was fallen in age, and had
<span class="rightnote">Maximianus is sent for. Conan Meridoc duke of Cornewall. This agréeth not with
that which is found in the Scotish chronicles.</span>
no issue but one daughter, he was counselled to send vnto Rome for one Maximianus, a
noble yoong man, coosine to the emperour Constantine, on the part of his mother Helena,
to come into Britaine, and to take to his wife the said daughter of Octauius, and so with
hir to haue the kingdome. Octauius at the first meant to haue giuen hir in mariage vnto
one Conan Meridoc duke of Cornewall, which was his nephue: but when the lords would
not thereto agrée, at the length he appointed one Maurice sonne to the said Conan to go to
Rome to fetch the forenamed Maximianus.</p>
<p>
Maurice according to his commission and instruction in that behalfe receiued, came to
<span class="leftnote">Maximianus commeth into Britaine.</span>
Rome, and declared his message in such effectuall sort, that Maximianus consented to go
with him into Britaine, and so taking with him a conuenient number, set forward, and did so
much by his iournies, that finallie he landed here in Britaine. And notwithstanding that
Conan Meridoc past not so much to haue béene dooing with him, for malice that he conceiued
towards him, because he saw that by his meanes he should be put beside the crowne,
yet at length was Maximianus safelie brought to the kings presence, and of him honorablie
receiued, and finallie the mariage was knit vp, and solemnized in all princelie maner.
<span class="rightnote">Octauius departeth this life.</span>
Shortlie after, Octauius departed out of this life, after he had reigned the terme of fiftie and
foure yeares, as Fabian gathereth by that which diuers authors doo write, how he reigned
till the daies that Gratian and Valentinian ruled the Roman empire which began to gouerne
<span class="leftnote">382.</span>
in the yeare of our Lord (as he saith) 382, which is to be vnderstood of Gratian his reigne
after the deceasse of his vncle Valens, for otherwise a doubt maie rise, because Valentine
the father of Gratian admitted the said Gratian to the title of Augustus in the yeare of our
Lord 351.</p>
<p>
But to leaue the credit of the long reigne of Octauius, with all his and others gouernement
and rule ouer the Britains since the time of Constantius, vnto our British and Scotish writers,
let vs make an end with the gouernement of that noble emperour Constantine, and assured
branch of the Britains race, as borne of that worthie ladie the empresse Helen, daughter to
Coell earle of Colchester, and after king of Britaine (as our histories doo witnesse.) Vnto<span class="page"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>[Page&nbsp;534]</span>
the which empresse Constantine bare such dutifull reuerence, that he did not onelie honour
hir with the name of empresse, but also made hir as it were partaker with him of all his
wealth, and in manie things was led and ruled by hir vertuous and godlie admonitions, to
the aduancement of Gods honour, and maintenance of those that professed the true christian
religion. For the loue that she bare vnto Colchester and London, she walled them about,
and caused great bricke and huge tiles to be made for the performance of the same, whereof
there is great store to be séene euen yet to this present, both in the walls of the towne and
<span class="rightnote"><i>Nicephorus</i>. The empresse Helen departeth this life.</span>
castell of Colchester, as a testimonie of the woorkemanship of those daies. She liued 79
yeares, and then departed this life about the 21 yeare of hir sonnes reigne. First she was
buried at Rome without the walls of the citie with all funerall pompe, as to hir estate apperteined:
<span class="leftnote">340. The deceasse of the emperour Constantine.</span>
but after hir corps was remoued and brought to Constantinople, where it was
eftsoones interred. Hir sonne the emperour Constantine liued till about the yeare of Christ
340, and then deceassed at Nicomedia in Asia, after he had ruled the empire 32 yeares and
od moneths.</p>
<p>
We find not in the Romane writers of anie great stur here in Britaine during his reigne
more than the British and Scotish writers haue recorded: so that after Traherne had reduced
this land to quietnesse, it maie be supposed, that the Britains liued in rest vnder his gouernement,
and likewise after vnder his sonnes that succéeded him in the empire, till about the
<span class="rightnote">360.</span>
yeare 360, at what time the Picts and Scots inuaded the south parts of the land.</p>
<p>
But now to end with Octauius, that the christian faith remained still in Britaine, during
the supposed time of this pretended kings reigne, it maie appeare, in that amongst the 36
prouinces, out of the which there were assembled aboue 300 bishops in the citie of Sardica
<span class="rightnote"><i>Synodus anno.</i> 354</span>
in Dacia, at a synod held there against the Eusebians, Britaine is numbred by Athanasius in
his second apologie to be one. And againe, the said Athanasius in an epistle which he
writeth to the emperour Iouinianus reciteth, that the churches in Britaine did consent with
the churches of other nations in the confession of faith articuled in the Nicene councell.
Also mention is made by writers of certeine godlie &amp; learned men, which liued in offices in
the church in those daies, as Restitutus bishop of London, which went ouer to the synod
held at Arles in France, and also one Kibius Corinnius sonne to Salomon duke of Cornewall,
and bishop of Anglesey, who instructed the people that inhabited the parts now called Northwales,
and them of Anglesey aforesaid verie diligentlie.</p>
<p>
But now to speake somewhat of things chancing in Britaine about this season (as we find
recorded by the Romane writers) some trouble was likelie to haue growne vnto the Britains
by receiuing certeine men of warre that fled out of Italie into Britaine, whome the emperour
<span class="rightnote"><i>Marcellinus. lib.</i> 14.</span>
Constantius would haue punished, because they had taken part with Maxentius his aduersarie.
<span class="leftnote">Paulus a notarie.</span>
Paulus a Spaniard and notarie was sent ouer by him, with commission to make inquirie of
them, and to sée them brought to light to answere their transgressions: which Paulus began
to deale roughlie in the matter, whereof he was called Catera, and to rage against the
Britains and partakers with the fugitiues, in that they had receiued and mainteined them, as
<span class="rightnote">Martinus lieutenant.</span>
he alledged: but in the end being certified by Martinus the lieutenant of their innocencie,
and fearing least his extreame rigour might alienate the hearts of the inhabitants altogither,
and cause them to withdraw their obedience from the Romane empire, he turned the execution
of his furie from them vnto the Romans, and made hauocke of those that he suspected,
till the said Martinus fell at square with him, &amp; thinking on a time to kill him, he drew his
sword and smote at him. But such was his age and weakenesse, that he was not able to kill
him or giue him anie deadlie wound: wherefore he turned the point of his sword against
himselfe, and so ended his life, being contented rather to die than sée his countriemen and
subiects of the empire so to be abused. After this the said Paulus returned backe againe
into Italie from whence he came, after whose departure, it was not long yer he also was slaine,
and then all the Scots and Picts sore disquieted the Romane subiects, for the suppressing of
whose attempts Lupicinus was sent ouer out of Gallia by Iulianus, as shall be declared out of
Amianus Marcellinus, after we haue first shewed what we find written in our owne writers<span class="page"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>[Page&nbsp;535]</span>
concerning the Scots and Picts, who now began to rob and spoile the British inhabitants
within the Romane prouinces here in this Ile, and that euen in most outragious maner.</p>

<h3>THE XXX CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">MAXIMIANUS OR MAXIMUS. 383.</span>
After the deceasse of Octauius or Octauian (as the old English chronicle nameth him)
Maximianus or Maximus (as the Romane writers call him) began to rule the Britains in the
yéere of our Lord 383, he was the sonne of one Leonine, and coosen germane to Constantine
the great, a valiant personage, &amp; hardie of stomach: but yet because he was cruell of
nature, and (as Fabian saith) somewhat persecuted the christians, he was infamed by writers:
but the chiefe cause why he was euil reported, was for that he slue his souereigne lord the emperour
Gratianus, as after shall appeare, for otherwise he is supposed woorthie to haue had
the rule of the empire committed to his hands in ech respect. Betwixt him and the aboue-named
Conan Meridoc duke of Cornewall, chanced strife and debate, so that Conan got
him into Scotland, and there purchasing aid, returned, and comming ouer Humber, wasted
the countrie on ech side. Maximianus thereof hauing aduertisement, raised his power and
went against him, and so fighting with him diuers battels, sometime departed awaie with
victorie, and sometime with losse. At length through mediation of friends, a peace was
made betwixt them. Finallie this Maximianus, or (as the Romane histories say) Maximus,
was by the souldiers chosen and proclaimed emperour here in Britaine: although some write
that this was doone in Spaine.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gal. Mon. Fabian. Caxton. Matth. West.</i> The British youth led forth of the
realme by Maximianus. Britaine in France.</span>
After he had taken vpon him the imperiall dignitie, vpon desire to haue inlarged his dominion,
he assembled togither all the chosen youth of this land méet to doo seruice in the
warres, with the which he passed ouer into France, &amp; there (as our writers record) he first
subdued the countrie ancientlie called Armorica, and slue in battell the king thereof called
Imball. This doone he gaue the countrie vnto Conan Meridoc, which was there with him,
to hold the same of him, and of the kings of great Britaine for euer. He also commanded
that the said countrie from thencefoorth should be called litle Britaine, and so was the name
changed. What people soeuer inhabited there before, the ancient name argueth that they
were rather Britains than anie other: for Armorica in the British toong signifieth as much as
a countrie lieng vpon the sea.</p>
<p>
Conan then placing himselfe and his Britains in that quarter of Gallia, auoided all the old
inhabitants, peopling that countrie onelie with Britains, which abhorring to ioine themselues
with women borne in Gallia, Conan was counselled to send into Britaine for maids to be
<span class="rightnote">Dionethius duke of Cornwall.</span>
coupled with his people in mariage. Herevpon a messenger was dispatched vnto Dionethus
at that time duke of Cornwall, and gouernour of Britaine vnder Maximianus, requiring him
<span class="leftnote">Maids sent foorth.</span>
to send ouer into little Britaine 11000 maids, that is to say, 8000 to be bestowed vpon the
meaner sort of Conans people, and 3000 to be ioined in mariage with the nobles and gentlemen.
Dionethus at Conans request, assembled the appointed number of maids, and
amongst them he also appointed his daughter Vrsula, a ladie of excellent beautie, to go ouer
and to be giuen in mariage to the foresaid Conan Meridoc, as he had earnestlie requested.,</p>
<p>
<span class="page"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>[Page&nbsp;536]</span>
<span class="rightnote">Vrsula the daughter of Dionethus.</span>
These number of maids were shipped in Thames, and passing forward toward Britaine,
were by force of weather and rage of wind scattered abroad, and part of them drowned,
and the residue (among whom was the foresaid Vrsula) were slaine by Guanius king of the
Hunnes, and Melga king of the Picts, into whose hands they fell, the which Guanius and
Melga were sent by the emperour Gracian to the sea coasts of Germanie, to oppresse and
subdue all such as were friends and mainteiners of the part of Maximianus. We find in
some bookes, that there were sent ouer at that time 51000 maids, that is to say, 11000
gentlewomen, and 40000 other.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Guanius and Melga.</span>
After that Guanius and Melga had murthered the foresaid virgins, they entred into the
north parts of Britaine, where the Scots now inhabit, and began to make sore warre on the
Britains, whereof when Maximus was aduertised, he sent into Britaine one Gratianus with
thrée legions of souldiers, who bare himselfe so manfullie against the enimies, that he constreined
the said Guanius and Melga to flie out of the land, and to withdraw into Ireland. In
this meane while, Maximus hauing slaine the emperor Gratian at Lions in France, and after
entring into Italie, was slaine himselfe at Aquilia (after he had gouerned the Britains eight
yéeres) by the emperour Theodosius, who came in aid of Valentinian, brother to the said
emperor Gratian, as ye may find in the abridgement of the histories of Italie.</p>
<p>
¶ But here yet before we make an end with this Maximus or Maximianus, I haue thought
good to set downe the words which we find in Gyldas, where he writeth of the same Maximus,
<span class="rightnote">Consobrinus Helenæ imperatricis.</span>
vndoubtedlie a Britaine borne, nephue to the empresse Helen, and begotten by a
Romane. "At length (saith Gyldas) the spring of tyrants budding vp, and now increasing
into an huge wood, the Ile being called after the name of Rome, but holding neither maners
nor lawes according to that name, but rather casting the same from it, sendeth foorth a
branch of hir most bitter planting, to wit Maximus, accompanied with a great number of
warriors to gard him, and apparelled in the imperiall robes which he neuer ware as became
him, nor put them on in lawfull wise, but (after the custome of tyrants) was put into them
by the mutining souldiers: which Maximus at the first by craftie policie rather than by true
manhood winding in (as nets of his periurie and false suggestion) vnto his wicked gouernement
the countries &amp; prouinces next adioining, against the imperiall state of Rome, stretching
one of his wings into Spaine, and the other into Italie, placed the throne of his most
vniust empire at Trier, and shewed such rage in his wood dealing against his souereigne
lords, that the one of the lawfull emperours he expelled out of Rome, and the other he
bereft of his most religious and godlie life. Now without long tariance, compassed about
with such a furious and bold gard as he had got togither, at the citie of Aquilia he loseth his
wicked head, which had cast downe the most honourable heads of all the world from their
kingdome and empire.</p>
<p>
"From thencefoorth Britaine being depriued of all hir warlike souldiers and armies, of
hir gouernors also (though cruell) and of an huge number of hir youth (the which following
the steps of the foresaid tyrant, neuer returned home againe) such as remained being vtterlie
vnskilfull in feats of warre, were troden downe by two nations of beyond the seas, the Scots
<span class="rightnote">Scotorum à circio, Pictorum ab aquilone.</span>
from the west, and the Picts from the north, and as men thus quite dismaid, lament their
miserable case, not knowing what else to doo for the space of manie yéeres togither. By
reason of whose gréeuous inuasion and cruell oppression wherewith she was miserablie disquieted,
she sendeth hir ambassadors vnto Rome, making lamentable sute euen with teares
to haue some power of men of warre sent to defend hir against the enimies, promising to be
true subiects with all faithfulnes of mind, if the enimie might be kept off and remooued."</p>

<i>What Gratianus it was that was sent ouer from Rome into Britaine by Maximus, in what
estimation the British souldiers haue béene, the priuie treason of Andragatius whereby
Gratian came to his end: Maximus and his sonne Victor doo succéed him in the empire,

<h3>THE XXXJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
But now where the British histories, and such of our English writers as follow them,
make mention of one Gratianus a Romane, sent ouer with thrée legions of souldiers by
Maximus, as before ye haue heard: we maie suppose that it was Gratianus the Britaine, that
afterwards vsurped the imperiall dignitie héere in Britaine, in the daies of the emperour
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sextus Aurelius</i></span>
Honorius. For it standeth neither with the concurrence of time nor yet with reason of the
historie, that it should be Gratianus, surnamed Funarius, father to Valentinian, and grandfather
to the emperour Gratianus, against whome Maximus rebelled. And yet I remember
not that anie of the Romane writers maketh mention of anie other Gratianus, being a stranger,
that should be sent hither as lieutenant to gouerne the Romane armie, except of the foresaid
<span class="rightnote"><i>Lib. 30.</i></span>
Gratianus Funarius, who (as appéereth by Amian. Marcellinus) was generall of the
Romane armie héere in this Ile, and at length being discharged, returned home into Hungarie
(where he was borne) with honour, and there remaining in rest, was at length spoiled
of his goods by the emperour Constantius as confiscate, for that in time of the ciuill warres
he had receiued Maxentius, as he past thorough his countrie.</p>
<p>
But let vs grant, that either Gratianus the Britaine, or some other of that name, was sent
ouer into Britaine (as before is said) by Maximus, least otherwise some errour may be doubted
in the writers of the British histories, as hauing happilie mistaken the time and matter, bringing
Gratianus Funarius to serue vnder Maximus, where peraduenture that which they haue
read or heard of him, chanced long before that time by them suppposed: and so thorough
mistaking the thing, haue made a wrong report, where neuerthelesse it standeth with great
likelihood of truth, that some notable seruice of chiualrie was atchiued by the same Gratianus
Funarius whilest he remained héere in this Ile, if the truth might be knowne of that
which hath béene written by authors, and happilie by the same Am. Marcellinus, if his first
thirtéene bookes might once come to light and be extant.</p>
<p>
But now to end with Maximus. William of Malmesburie (as ye haue heard) writeth, that
not Maximus, but rather Constantine the great first peopled Armorica: but yet he agréeth,
that both Maximus, and also Constantinus the vsurper, of whome after ye shall heare, led
with them a great number of the Britains out of this land, the which Maximus or Maximianus
and Constantinus afterwards being slaine, the one by Theodosius, and the other by Honorius,
the Britains that followed them to the warres, part of them were killed, and the
residue escaping by flight, withdrew vnto the other Britains which Constantine the great had
first placed in Armorica. And so when the tyrants had left none in the countrie but rude
people, nor anie in the townes but such as were giuen to slouth and gluttonie, Britaine
being void of all aid of hir valiant youth, became a prey to hir next neighbours the Scots
and Picts.</p>
<p>
Héere is yet to be considered, in what price the souldiers of the British nation were had in
those daies, with whose onelie puissance Maximus durst take vpon him to go against all other
the forces of the whole Romane empire: and how he prospered in that dangerous aduenture,
it is expressed sufficientlie in the Romane histories, by whose report it appéereth, that
<span class="rightnote"><i>W.H.</i> out of <i>Paulus Diaco. lib. 12. &amp; alijs.</i></span><span class="page"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>[Page&nbsp;538]</span>
he did not onlie conquer all the hither parts of France and Germanie, namelie on this side
the Rhine, but also found meanes to intrap the emperour Gratian by this kind of policie.
He had a faithfull friend called Andragatius, who was admirall of the seas perteining to the
empire. It was therefore agréed betwixt them, that this Andragatius (with a chosen companie
of the armie) should be carried in secret wise in a coch toward Lions, as if it had béene
<span class="rightnote"><i>Tripart. hist. lib. 9. cap. 21.</i></span>
Constantia Posthumia the empresse, wife to the emperour Gratian, bruting abroad there
withall, that the said empresse was comming forwards on hir waie to Lions, there to méet
with hir husband, for that vpon occasion she was verie desirous to commune with him about
certeine earnest businesse.</p>
<p>
When Gratian heard héereof, as one mistrusting no such dissimulation, he made hast to
meete his wife, and comming at length without anie great gard about him, as one not in
doubt of anie treason, approched the coch, where supposing to find his wife, he found those
that streightwaies murthered him: &amp; so was he there dispatched quite of life by the said
Andragatius, who leapt foorth of the coch to woorke that feate when he had him once within
his danger.</p>
<p>
Thus did the emperour Gratian finish his life in the 29 yéere of his age, on the 25 of
<span class="rightnote">383.</span>
August, in the yéere of Christ 383, and then died. Maximus succéeded him (making his
<span class="rightnote">This Flauius Victor he begat of his wife Helen the daughter of Eudes. <i>H. Lhoyd.</i></span>
sonne Flauius Victor Nobilissimus his assistant in the empire) reigning fiue yéeres and two
daies. In the beginning of his reigne Valentinian the yoonger made great suit to him to
haue his fathers bodie, but it would not be granted. Afterwards also Maximus was earnestlie
requested to come to an enteruiew with the same Valentinian, who promised him not onelie a
safe conduct, but also manie other beneficiall good turnes beside. Howbeit Maximus durst
not put himselfe in anie such hazard, but rather ment to pursue Valentinian as an vsurper,
and so at length chased him into Slauonie, where he was driuen to such a streight, that if
<span class="rightnote">Valentinian put in danger by Maximus.</span>
Theodosius had not come to releeue him, Maximus had driuen him thence also, or else by
slaughter rid him out of the waie.</p>
<p>
But when Maximus thought himselfe most assured, and so established in the empire, as he
doubted no perils, he liued carelesse of his owne safegard, and therfore dismissed his British
souldiers, who retiring into the northwest parts of Gallia, placed themselues there among
their countriemen, which were brought ouer by the emperour Constantius, whilest Maximus
<span class="rightnote"><i>Eutropius</i>. 388.</span>
passing the residue of his time in delights and pleasures, was surprised in the end and slaine
by Theodosius néere vnto Aquilia, the 27 of August, in the yéere of Grace 388, and in the
beginning of the sixt yéere of his reigne, or rather vsurpation, as more rightlie it maie be
tearmed. His sonne Flauius Victor surnamed Nobilissimus was also dispatched and brought
to his end, not farre from the place where his father was slaine, by the practise of one Arbogastes
<span class="rightnote">Arbogastes.</span>
a Goth, which Flauius Victor was by the said Maximus made regent of the Frankeners,
and partaker (as before is said) with him in the empire.</p>
<p>
After this, the Ile of Britaine remained in méetlie good quiet by the space of twentie yéeres,
till one Marcus (that was then legat, or as we maie call him lord lieutenant or deputie of
Britaine for the Romans) was by the souldiers héere proclaimed emperour against Honorius,
which Marcus was soone after killed in a tumult raised among the people within few daies
<span class="rightnote">Gratianus a Britaine. He reigned foure yéeres if we shal beléeue the British historie.</span>
after his vsurpation began. Then one Gratianus a Britaine borne succéeded in his place,
who was also slaine in the fourth moneth, after he had taken vpon him the imperiall ornaments.
The souldiers not yet heerewith pacified, procéeded to the election of an other emperour,
or rather vsurper, and so pronounced a noble gentleman called Constantine, borne
<span class="leftnote">409.</span>
also in Britaine, to be emperour, who tooke that honour vpon him in the 409 yéere after the
birth of our Sauiour, continuing his reigne by the space of two yéeres and od moneths, as
the Romane histories make mention. Some report this Constantine to be of no great towardlie
disposition woorthie to gouerne an empire, and that the souldiers chose him rather
for the name sake, bicause they would haue another Constantine, more than for anie vertues
or sufficient qualities found in his person. But other commend him both for manhood and
wisedome, wherein to speake a truth, he deserued singular commendation, if this one note
of vsurpation of the imperiall dignitie had not stained his other noble qualities. But heerein<span class="page"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>[Page&nbsp;539]</span>
he did no more than manie other would haue doone, neither yet after his inuesture did so
much as was looked for at his hands.</p>
<p>
Constantine being placed in the imperiall throne, gathered an armie with all possible indeuour,
purposing out of hand to go ouer therwith into France, and so did, thinking thereby
to win the possession of that countrie out of the hands of Honorius, or at the least to worke
so, as he should not haue the souldiers and people there to be against him, if he missed to
ioine in league with the Suabeiners, Alanes, and Vandales, which he sought to performe.
But in the end, when neither of these his deuises could take place, he sent ouer for his
sonne Constans (whome in his absence his aduersaries had shorne a moonke) &amp; making him
partaker with him in the empire, caused him to bring ouer with him another armie, which
vnder the conduct of the same Constans he sent into Spaine to bring that countrie vnder his
obeisance.</p>
<p>
This Constans therefore comming vnder the passages that lead ouer the Pyrenine mountains,
Dindimus and Verianianus two brethren, vnto whome the keeping of those passages
<span class="rightnote">His souldiers were Picts, and placed among other men of warre that serued vnder
the ensignes of the empire, and named after Honorius, Honoriciani. <i>Blondus.</i></span>
was committed to defend the same against the Vandals, and all other enimies of the empire,
were readie to resist him with their seruants and countriemen that inhabited therabouts,
giuing him a verie sharpe incounter, and at the first putting him in great danger of an ouerthrow,
but yet at length by the valiant prowes of his British souldiers, Constans put his
aduersaries to flight, and killed the two capteins, with diuers other men of name, that were
partakers with him in the necessarie defense of that countrie against the enimies. When
Constans had thus repelled those that resisted him, the custodie of the passages in the Pyrenine
mounteins was committed vnto such bands of Picts and other, as were appointed to
go with him about the atchiuing of this enterprise, who hauing the possession of those streicts
or passages in their hands, gaue entrie vnto other barbarous nations to inuade Spaine, who
being once entered, pursued the former inhabitants with fire and swoord, setled them selues
in that countrie, and droue out the Romans.</p>

<a name="xxxij4" id="xxxij4"></a>
<p>
<i>Honorius sendeth earle Constantius to expell Constantine out of Gallia, the end of Constantinus
the father and Constans the sonne, the valure and prowesse of the British
souldiers, the British writers reprooued of necligences for that they haue inserted fables
into their woorkes, whereas they might haue deposed matters of truth.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXXIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
The emperour Honorius, perceiuing the réeling state of the empire, determined, foorthwith
to recouer it, before it fell altogither into ruine: and therefore sent one Constantius an
earle to driue Constantine out of Gallia, which he accordinglie performed: for after certeine
bickerings, he slue the said Constantine at Arles, although not without great bloudshed.
He pursued also the residue of the Britains, driuing them to the verie sea coasts, where they
shrowded themselues among the other Britains, that before were setled in the countrie there,
ancientlie called (as before we said) Armorica, that is, a region lieng on the sea coast: for
<i>Ar</i> in the British toong signifieth vpon; and <i>Moure</i>, perteining to the sea. And as this
Constantine the father was slaine by Constantius, so was Constans the sonne killed at Vienna
by one of his owne capteines named Gerontius. Whereby it came to passe, that Honorius
shortlie after, hauing thus obteined the victorie of both these vsurpers, recouered the Ile,
but yet not till the yeare next following, and that by the high industrie and great diligence
of that valiant gentleman earle Constantius. The slaughter of Constantine &amp; his sonne happened
in the 1 yeare of the 297 Olympiad, 465 after the comming of Cesar, 1162 after the
building of Rome, the dominicall letter being A, and the golden number 13, so that the<span class="page"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>[Page&nbsp;540]</span>
<span class="rightnote">411.</span>
recouering of the Iland fell in the yeare of our Lord 411.</p>
<p>
Here also is eftsoones to be considered the valure of the British souldiers, who following
this last remembred Constantine the vsurper, did put the Romane state in great danger, and
by force brake through into Spaine, vanquishing those that kept the streicts of the mounteins
betwixt Spaine and Gallia, now called France, an exploit of no small consequence, sith
thereby the number of barbarous nations got frée passage to enter into Spaine, whereof
insued manie battels, sacking of cities and townes, and wasting of the countries, accordinglie
as the furious rage of those fierce people was mooued to put their crueltie in practise.</p>
<p>
¶ If therefore the Britaine writers had considered and marked the valiant exploits and
noble enterprisee which the Brittish aids, armies and legions atchiued in seruice of the Romane
emperours (by whome whilest they had the gouernement ouer this Ile, there were at
sundrie times notable numbers conueied foorth into the parties of beyond the seas, as by
Albinus and Constantius, also by his sonne Constantine the great, by Maximus, and by this
Constantine, both of them vsurpers) if (I saie) the British writers had taken good note of
the numbers of the British youth thus conueied ouer from hence, &amp; what notable exploits
they boldlie attempted, &amp; no lesse manfullie atchiued, they néeded not to haue giuen eare
vnto the fabulous reports forged by their Bards, of Arthur and other their princes, woorthie
in déed of verie high commendation.</p>
<p>
And pitie it is, that their fame should be brought by such meanes out of credit, by the
incredible and fond fables which haue béene deuised of their acts so vnlike to be true, as the
tales of Robin Hood, or the gests written by Ariost the Italian in his booke intituled
"Orlando furioso," sith the same writers had otherwise true matter inough to write of
concerning the worthie feats by their countriemen in those daies in forren parts boldlie enterprised,
and no lesse valiantlie accomplished, as also the warres which now and then they
mainteined against the Romans here at home, in times when they felt themselues oppressed
by their tyrannicall gouernment, as by that which is written before of Caratacus, Voadicia,
Cartimandua, Venusius, Galgagus, or Galdus (as some name him) and diuers other, who
for their noble valiancies deserue as much praise, as by toong or pen is able to be expressed.
But now to returne vnto the British historie: we will procéed in order with their kings as
we find them in the same mentioned, and therefore we haue thought good to speake somewhat
further of Gratian, from whome we haue digressed.</p>

<i>Gratians rough regiment procureth his owne destruction, the comming of his two brethren
Guanius and Melga with their armies, the Scots and Picts plague the Britains, they
send for aid to Rome, Valentinian sendeth Gallio Rauenna to reléeue them, the Romans
refuse anie longer to succour the Britains, whom they taught how to make armour and
weapons, the Scots and Picts enter afresh into Britaine and preuaile, the Britains are
brought to extreme miserie, ciuill warres among them, and what mischiefe dooth follow
therevpon, their lamentable letter to Actius for succour against their enimies, their sute

<h3>THE XXXIIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">GRATIANUS.</span>
Gratianus then, whome Maximus or Maximinus had sent into Britaine (as before
ye haue heard) hearing that his maister was slaine, tooke vpon him the rule of this our
<span class="leftnote">390.</span>
Britaine, and made himselfe king therof, in the yeare 390. He was a Britaine borne, as
Polydor writeth, coniecturing so, by that he is named of authors to be Municeps, that is to
<span class="rightnote">Of the Romane souldiers as <i>Blondus</i> saith.</span><span class="page"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>[Page&nbsp;541]</span>
saie, a frée man of the countrie or citie where he inhabited. For his sternenesse and rough
gouernement, he was of the Britains (as the histories alledge) slaine and dispatched out of
the waie, after he had reigned the space of foure yeares, or rather foure moneths, as should
séeme by that which is found in autentike writers. Then the forenamed kings Guantius and
<span class="leftnote"><i>Galfrid. Caxton.</i></span>
Melga, which (as some write) were brethren, returned into this land with their armies increased
with new supplies of men of warre, as Scots, Danes, the Norwegians, and destroied
the countrie from side to side. For the Britains in this season were sore inféebled, and were
<span class="rightnote"><i>Galfrid. Matth. West. Caxton.</i></span>
not able to make anie great numbers of souldiers, by reason that Maximus had led foorth
of the land the floure and chiefest choise of all the British youth into Gallia, as before ye
haue heard.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gyldas.</i></span>
Gyldas maketh no mention of these two kings Guanius and Melga of the Hunnes, but
rehearsing this great destruction of the land, declareth (as before ye haue heard) that the
Scots and Picts were the same that did all the mischiefe, whome he calleth two nations of
beyond the seas, the Scots comming out of the northwest, and the Picts out of the northeast,
by whome (as he saith) the land was ouerrun, and brought vnder foot manie yeares after.
Therefore the Britains being thus vexed, spoiled, and cruellie persecuted by the Scots and
Picts (if we shall so take them) sent messengers with all spéed vnto Rome to make sute for
some aid of men of war to be sent into Britaine.  Wherevpon immediatlie a legion of
<span class="rightnote">414.</span>
souldiers was sent thither in the yéere 414, which easilie repelled the enimies, and chased
them backe with great slaughter, to the great comfort of the Britains, the which by this
meanes were deliuered from danger of vtter destruction, as they thought.</p>
<p>
But the Romans being occasioned to depart againe out of the land, appointed the Britains
to make a wall (as had béene aforetime by the emperours Adrian, Antoninus and Seuerus)
<span class="rightnote"><i>Beda</i> and <i>Polychron.</i></span>
ouerthwart the countrie from sea to sea, stretching from Penuelton vnto the citie of Aclud,
whereby the enimies might be staid from entring the land: but this wall being made of turfs
and sods, rather than with stones, after the departure of the Romans was easilie ouerthrowne
by the Scots and Picts, which eftsoones returned to inuade the confines of the Britains, and
so entring the countrie, wasted and destroied the places before them, according to their
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gyldas. Polychron. Beda. Matth. West.</i></span>
former custome. Herevpon were messengers with most lamentable letters againe dispatched
towards Rome for new aid against those cruell enimies, with promise, that if the Romans
would now in this great necessitie helpe to deliuer the land, they should be assured to find
the Britains euermore obedient subiects, and redie at their commandement. Valentinianus
<span class="rightnote"><i>Blondus.</i> Gallio Ravenna sent into Brittaine.</span>
(pitieng the case of the poore Britains) appointed another legion of souldiers (of the which
one Gallio of Rauenna had the leading) to go to their succours, the which arriuing in Britaine
set on the enimies, and giuing them the ouerthrow, slue a great number of them, and chased
the residue out of the countrie.</p>
<p>
The Romans thus hauing obteined the victorie, declared to the Britains, that from thencefoorth
they would not take vpon them for euerie light occasion so painefull a iournie, alledging
how there was no reason why the Romane ensignes, with such a number of men
of warre, should be put to trauell so far by sea and land, for the repelling and beating backe
of a sort of scattering rouers and pilfring théeues. Wherfore they aduised the Britains to
looke to their dueties, and like men to indeuour themselues to defend their countrie by their
owne force from the enimies inuasions. And because they iudged it might be an helpe to
the Britains, they set in hand to build a wall yet once againe ouerthwart the Ile, in the same
<span class="rightnote">A wall built overthwart the Iland. <i>Beda</i>.</span>
place where the emperour Seuerus caused his trench and rampire to be cast. This wall
which the Romans now built with helpe of the Britains, was 8 foot in bredth and 12 in
length, trauersing the land from east to west, &amp; was made of stone. </p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gyldas and Beda.</i></span>
After that this wall was finished, the Romans exhorted the Britains to plaie the men, and
shewed them the way how to make armor &amp; weapons. Besides this, on the coast of the
east sea where their ships lay at rode, &amp; where it was douted that the enimies would land,
they caused towers to be erected, with spaces betwixt, out of the which the seas might be
<span class="rightnote"><i>Gyldas.</i></span>
discouered. These things ordered, the Romans bad the Britains farewell, not minding to
returne thither againe. The Romans then being gon out of the land, the Scots and Picts<span class="page"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>[Page&nbsp;542]</span>
knowing thereof, by &amp; by came againe by sea, &amp; being more emboldened than before, bicause
of the deniall made by the Romans to come any more to the succor of the Britains,
they tooke into possession all the north and vttermost bounds of the Ile, euen vnto the foresaid
<span class="rightnote">This chanced in the yere 43. as <i>M. W.</i> saith.</span>
wall, therein to remaine as inhabitants. And wheras the Britains got them to their
wall to defend the same, that the enimies should not passe further into the countrie, they
were in the end beaten from it, and diuers of them slaine, so that the Scots and Picts entred
vpon them and pursued them in more cruell maner than before, so that the Britains being
chased out of their cities, townes, and dwelling houses, were constreined to flie into desert
places, and there to remaine and liue after the maner of sauage people, and in the
end began to rob and spoile one another, so to auoid the danger of staruing for lacke of
food: and thus at the last the countrie was so destroied and wasted, that there was no other
shift for them that was left aliue to liue by, except onelie by hunting and taking of wild
<span class="rightnote"><i>Hector Boet.</i> Rebellion.</span>
beasts and foules. And to augment their miserie, the commons imputing the fault to rest
in the lords and gouernors, arose against them in armes, but were vanquished and easilie
put to flight at two seuerall times, being beaten downe and slaine (through lacke of skill)
in such numbers, especiallie the latter time, that the residue which escaped, withdrew into
the craggie mounteins, where within the bushes and caues they kept themselues close,
sometimes comming downe and fetching away from the heards of beasts and flocks of shéepe
which belonged to the nobles and gentlemen of the countrie, great booties to relieue them
withall. But at length oppressed with extreme famine, when neither part could long remaine
in this state, as néeding one anothers helpe, necessitie made peace betwixt the lords
<span class="rightnote">Ciuill warre decaied the force of the Britains. What mischiefe follow of ciuill warres.</span>
and commons of the land, all iniuries being pardoned and cléerelie forgiuen. This ciuill
warre decaied the force of the Britains, little lesse than the tyrannicall practises of Maximus,
for by the auoiding of the commons thus out of their houses, the ground laie vntilled, whereof
insued such famine for the space of thrée yéeres togither, that a woonderfull number of
people died for want of sustenance.</p>
<p>
Thus the Britains being brought generallie into such extreame miserie, they thought good
<span class="rightnote">Actius.</span>
to trie if they might purchase some aid of that noble man Actius, which at that time remained
in France as yet called Gallia, gouerning the same as lieutenant vnder the emperor
Honorius: and herevpon taking counsell togither, they wrote a letter to him, the tenor
whereof insueth.</p>
<p>
<i>To Actius thrise consull.</i></p>
<p>
"The lamentable request of vs the Britains, beseeching you of aid to bee ministred vnto
the prouince of the Romane empire, vnto our countrie, vnto our wiues and children at
this present, which stand in most extreame perill. For the barbarous people driue vs to the
sea, and the sea driueth vs backe vnto them againe. Hereof rise two kinds of death, for
either we are slaine, or drowned, and against such euils haue we no remedie nor helpe at
all. Therefore in respect of your clemencie, succor your owne we most instantlie require
you, &amp;c."</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding the Britains thus sought for aid at Actius hands as then the emperours
<span class="rightnote">The Britains could get no aid fr&#333; the Romans.</span>
lieutenant, yet could they get none; either for that Actius would not, as he that passed
litle how things went, bicause he bare displeasure in his mind against Valentinian as then
emperor; or else for that he could not, being otherwise constreined to imploie all his
forces in other places against such barbarous nations as then inuaded the Romane empire.
And so by that means was Britaine lost, and the tribute which the Britains were accustomed
to pay to the Romans ceassed, iust fiue hundred yéeres after that Iulius Cesar first
entred the Ile.</p>
<p>
The Britains being thus put to their shifts, manie of them as hunger-starued were constrained
to yéeld themselues into the griping hands of their enimies, whereas other yet
kéeping within the mounteins, woods and caues, brake out as occasion serued vpon their<span class="page"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>[Page&nbsp;543]</span>
aduersaries, and then first (saith Gyldas) did the Britains not putting their trust in man but
in God (according to the saieng of Philo, Where mans helpe faileth, it is needfull that Gods
helpe be present) make slaughter of their enimies that had béene accustomed manie yéeres
<span class="rightnote">Punishment ceaseth, but sin increaseth.</span>
to rob and spoile them in maner as before is recited, and so the bold attempts of the enimies
ceassed for a time, but the wickednesse of the British people ceassed not at all. The enimies
departed out of the land, but the inhabitants departed not from their naughtie dooings, being
not so readie to put backe the common enimies, as to exercise ciuill warre and discord
among themselues. The wicked Irish people departed home, to make returne againe within
a while after. But the Picts settled themselues first at that season in the vttermost bounds
of the Ile, and there continued, making insurrections oftentimes vpon their neighbours, and
spoiling them of their goods.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Galfridus. Gyldas</i> his words are to be considered.</span>
This with more also hath Gyldas, and likewise Beda written of this great desolation of
the British people: wherein if the words of Gyldas be well weighed and considered, it
maie lead vs to thinke, that the Scots had no habitations here in Britaine, but onelie in
Ireland, till after this season, and that at this present time the Picts, which before inhabited
within the Iles of Orkenie, now placed themselues in the north parts of Scotland, and after
by processe of time came and nestled themselues in Louthian, in the Mers, and other
countries more neere to our borders. But to procéed.</p>
<p>
The British histories affirme, that whilest the Britains were thus persecuted by these two
most cruell and fierce nations the Scots and Picts, the noble and chiefest men amongst them
<span class="rightnote">An ambassage sent from the Britains vnto Aldroenus king of Britaine in France.</span>
consulted togither, &amp; concluded to send an honorable ambassage vnto Aldroenus as then
king of little Britaine in Gallia, which Aldroenus was the fourth from Conan Meridoc the first
king there of the British nation. Of this ambassage the archbishop of London named
Guetheline or Gosseline was appointed the chiefe and principall, who passing ouer into little
Britaine, and comming before the presence of Aldroenus, so declared the effect of his message,
<span class="leftnote">Constantine the brother of Aldroenus</span>
that his suit was granted. For Aldroenus agréed to send his brother Constantine
ouer into great Britaine with a conuenient power, vpon condition, that the victorie being obteined
against the enimies, the Britains should make him king of great Britaine.</p>
<p>
¶ Thus it is apparent, that this land of Britaine was without anie certeine gouernour
(after that Gratian the vsurper was dispatched) a number of yéeres togither, but how manie,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Fabian.</i></span>
writers in their account do varie. Fabian deposeth by diuers coniecturs that the space betwixt
the death of Gratian, and the beginning of the reigne of the said Constantine, brother
to Aldroenus, continued nine and thirtie yéeres, during which time the Britains were sore
and miserablie afflicted by the inuasions of the Scots and Picts, as before ye haue heard by
testimonies taken out of Beda, Gyldas, Geffrey of Monmouth, and other writers both British
and English.</p>

<h3>THE XXXIIIJ CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Maximus. 383.</span>
But now sith no mention is made of the Scots in our histories, till the daies of Maximus
the vsurper or tyrant, as some call him, who began his reigne here in Britaine about the
<span class="page"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>[Page&nbsp;544]</span>
yéere of our Lord 383, and that till after he had bereft the land of the chiefest forces thereof,
in taking the most part of the youth ouer with him: we find not in the same histories of
anie troubles wrought to the Britains by that nation. Therefore we haue thought good
héere to come backe to the former times, that we may shew what is found mentioned in
the Romane histories, both before that time and after, as well concerning the Scots and Picts,
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ammianus Marcellinus lib.</i> 20. The emperor Iulianius.</span>
as also the Saxons, and especiallie in Ammianus Marcellinus, where in the beginning of his
twentith booke intreating of the doings of the emperour Iulianus, he saith as followeth.</p>
<p>
In this state stood things in Illyricum or Slauonia, and in the east parts, at what time
Constantius bare the office of consull the tenth time, and Iulianus the third time, that is to
<span class="leftnote">360.</span>
say, in the yéere of our Lord 360, when in Britaine quietnesse being disturbed by roads made
<span class="rightnote">Scots and Picts trouble the state of this Ile.</span>
by the Scots and Picts, which are wild and sauage people, the frontiers of the countrie were
wasted, and feare oppressed the prouinces wearied with the heape of passed losses. The
emperor [he meaneth Iulianus as then remaining at Paris, and hauing his mind troubled
with manie cares, doubted to go to the aid of them beyond the sea, as we haue shewed
that Constantius did, least he should leaue them in Gallia without a ruler, the Almains
being euen then prouoked and stirred vp to crueltie and warre.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Lupicinus sent into Britaine.</span>
He thought good therefore to send Lupicinus vnto these places to bring things into frame
and order, which Lupicinus was at that time master of the armorie, a warlike person and
skilfull in all points of chiualrie, but proud and high-minded beyond measure, and such
one as it was doubted long whether he was more couetous or cruell. Herevpon the said
<span class="rightnote">Bataui now Hollanders.</span>
Lupicinus setting forward the light armed men of the Heruli and Bataui, with diuers companies
also of the people of Mesia now called Bulgarie; when winter was well entred and
come on, he came himselfe to Bulleine, and there prouiding ships, and imbarking his men,
<span class="leftnote">Rutupis.</span>
when the wind serued his purpose, he transported ouer vnto Sandwich, and so marched foorth
unto London, from thence purposing to set forward, as vpon aduise taken according to the
qualitie of his businesse he should thinke méet and expedient.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Of the displacing of these men the learned
may sée more in <i>Am. Mar.</i></span>
In the meane time, whilest Lupicinus was busie here in Britaine to represse the enimies,
the emperour Constantius displaced certeine officers, and among other he depriued the same
Lupicinus of the office of the master of the armorie, appointing one Gumobarius to succéed
him in that roome, before anie such thing was knowen in these parties. And where it was
doubted least that Lupicinus (if he had vnderstood so much whilest he was yet in Britaine)
would haue attempted some new trouble, as he was a man of a stout and loftie mind, he
was called backe from thence, and withall there was sent a notarie vnto Bulleine, to watch
that none should passe the seas ouer into Britaine till Lupicinus were returned: and so returning
ouer from thence yer he had anie knowledge what was doone by the emperour, he
could make no sturre, hauing no such assistants in Gallia, as it was thought he might haue
had in Britaine, if he should haue mooued rebellion there.</p>
<p>
<span class="leftnote"><i>Lib.</i> 26.</span>
The same Marcellinus speaking of the doings about the time that Valentinianus, being
<span class="rightnote"><i>Ammianus Marcellinus lib.</i> 26.</span>
elected emperour, had admitted his brother Valens as fellow with him in gouernement, hath
these words. In this season as though trumpets had blowne the sound to battell through
out the whole Romane empire, most cruell nations being stirred vp, inuaded the borders
<span class="rightnote">The Almans. The Sarmatians. The Quadi Picts and Saxons. Austorians. The Goths.</span>
next adioining, the Almans wasted and destroied the parts of Gallia and Rhetia, as the
Sarmatians and Quadi did Paunonia, the Picts, the Saxons, the Scots, and the Attacots vexed
the Britains with continuall troubles, and gréeuous damages; the Austorians and the people
of the Moores ouerran the countrie of Affrike more sharpelie than in time past they had
done; the pilfring troops of the Goths spoiled Thracia; the king of Persia set in hand to
subdue the Armenians, and sought to bring them vnder his obeisance, hasting with all spéed
toward Numonia, pretending (though vniustlie) that now after the deceasse of Iouinius,
with whome he had contracted a league and bond of peace, there was no cause of let what
he ought not to recouer those things, which (as he alledged) did belong to his ancestors:
and so foorth.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Lib.</i> 27.</span>
Moreouer, the same Marcellinus in another place writeth in this wise, where he speaketh
of the said Valentinianus. Departing therefore from Amiens, and hasting to Trier, he was<span class="page"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>[Page&nbsp;545]</span>
troubled with gréeuous newes that were brought him, giuing him to vnderstand, that Britaine
<span class="rightnote">Comes maritimi tractus.</span>
by a conspiracie of the barbarous nations was brought to vtter pouertie, that Nectaridus one
of the emperours house earle of the sea coast, hauing charge of the parties towards the sea,
was slaine, and that the generall Bulchobaudes was circumuented by traines of the enimies.
These things with great horrour being knowne, he sent Seuerus as then erle, or (as I may
<span class="rightnote">Comes domesticorum.</span>
call him lord steward of his houshold) to reforme things that were amisse, if hap would
so permit, who being shortlie called backe, Iouinius going thither, and with spéed hasting
forward, sent for more aid and a great power of men, as the instant necessitie then required.
At length, for manie causes, and the same greatlie to be feared, the which were reported and
<span class="rightnote">Theodosius sent into Britaine.</span>
aduertised out of that Ile, Theodosius was elected and appointed to go thither, a man of
approoued skill in warlike affaires, and calling togither an hardie youthfull number of the
legions and cohorts of men of warre, he went foorth, no small hope being conceiued of
his good spéed; the fame wherof spred and went afore him.</p>
<p>
A litle after, Marcellinus adding what people they were that troubled the Britains in this
<span class="rightnote">Picts diuided into two nations. Attacotti.</span>
wise, saith thus. This shall suffice to be said, that in this season the Picts diuided into two
nations Dicalidones, and Victuriones, and in like maner the Attacotti a right warlike nation,
and the Scots wandering here and there, made fowle woorke in places where they came.
The confines of France were disquieted by the Frankeners and Saxons borderers vnto them,
euerie one as they could breaking foorth, &amp; dooing great harme by cruell spoile, fire, and
taking of prisoners. To withstand those dooings if good fortune would giue him leaue,
<span class="rightnote">Theodosius passeth ouer into Britaine.</span>
that most able capteine going vnto the vttermost bounds of the earth, when he came to the
coast of Bullen which is seuered from the contrarie coast on the other side by the sea, with
a narrow streight, where sometime the water goeth verie high and rough, &amp; shortlie after
becommeth calme &amp; pleasant, without hurt to those that passe the same, transporting ouer
at leasure, he arriued at Sandwich (or rather Richburrow) where there is a quiet road for
<span class="rightnote">Bataui Hollanders.</span>
vessels to lie at anchor. Wherevpon the Bataui and Heruli, with the souldiers of the legions
called Iouij, and Victores, being companies that trusted well to their owne strength, marched
<span class="leftnote">London called Augusta.</span>
foorth &amp; drew towards London, an ancient citie, which now of late hath bin called Augusta.
Herewith diuiding his armie into sundrie parts, he set vpon the troops of his enimies as
they were abroad to forrey the countrie, pestered with burdens of their spoiles and pillage,
and spéedilie putting them to flight, as they were leading away those prisoners which they
had taken, with their booties of cattell, he bereft them of their preie, the which the poore
Britains that were tributaries had lost. To be briefe, restoring the whole, except a small
portion bestowed amongst the wearie souldiers, he entred the citie which before was opprest
with troubles, but now suddenlie refreshed, bicause there was hope of reliefe and assured
preseruation.</p>
<p>
After this, when Theodosius was comforted with prosperous successe to attempt things of
greater importance, and searching waies how with good aduise to woorke suerlie: whilest
he remained doubtfull what would insue, he learned as well by the confession of prisoners
taken, as also by the information of such as were fled from the enimies, that the scattered
people of sundrie nations which with practise of great crueltie were become fierce and vndanted,
could not be subdued but by policie secretlie practised, and sudden inuasions. At
length therefore setting foorth his proclamations, and promising pardon to those that were
gone awaie from their capteins or charge, he called them backe againe to serue: and also
those that by licence were departed and laie scattered here and there in places abroad. By
this meanes, when manie were returned, he being on the one side earnestlie prouoked, and
<span class="rightnote">Theodosius requireth to haue Ciuilis sent to him.</span>
on the other holden backe with thoughtfull cares, required to haue one Ciuilis by name sent
to him to haue the rule of the prouinces in Britaine in steed of the other gouernours, a man
<span class="leftnote">Dulcitius.</span>
of sharpe wit, and an earnest mainteiner of iustice. He likewise required that one Dulcitius
a capteine renowmed in knowledge of warlike affaires might be sent ouer to him for
his better asistance. These things were doone in Britaine.</p>
<p>
Againe, in his eight and twentith booke, the same Marcellinus reciting further what the<span class="page"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>[Page&nbsp;546]</span>
same Theodosius atchiued in Britaine, hath in effect these words: Thedosius verelie a capteine
<span class="rightnote">London called Augusta.</span>
of woorthie fame, taking a valiant courage to him, and departing from Augusta, which
men of old time called London, with souldiers assembled by great diligence, did succour
and reléeue greatlie the decaied and troubled state of the Britains, preuenting euerie conuenient
place where the barbarous people might lie in wait to doo mischiefe: and nothing
he commanded the meane souldiers to doo, but that whereof he with a chéerefull mind
would first take in hand to shew them an example. By this meanes accomplishing the roome
of a valiant souldier, and fulfilling the charge of a noble capteine, he discomfited and put
to flight sundrie nations, whome presumption (nourished by securitie) emboldened to inuade
the Romane prouinces: and so the cities and castels that had béene sore endamaged by manifold
losses and displeasures, were restored to their former state of wealth, the foundation of
rest and quietnesse being laid for a long season after to insue.</p>
<p>
But as these things were a dooing, one wicked practise was in hand &amp; like to haue burst
foorth, to the gréeuous danger of setting things in broile, if it had not béene staied euen in
<span class="rightnote">Valentinus. Valeria now Stiermarke.</span>
the beginning of the first attempt. For there was one Valentinus, borne in the parties of
Valeria adioining to Pannonia, now called Stiermarke, a man of a proud and loftie stomach,
brother to the wife of Maximinus, which Valentinus for some notable offense had béene
banished into Britaine, where the naughtie man that could not rest in quiet, deuised how by
some commotion he might destroy Theodosius, who as he saw was onelie able to resist his
wicked purposes. And going about manie things both priuilie and apertlie, the force of his
vnmeasurable desire to mischiefe still increasing, he sought to procure aswell other that were
in semblable wise banished men, &amp; inclined to mischiefe like him selfe, as also diuers of the
souldiers, alluring them (as the time serued) with large promises of great wealth, if they
would ioine with him in that enterprise. But euen now in the verie nicke, when they shuld
haue gone in hand with their vngratious exploit, Theodosius warned of their intent, boldlie
aduanced himselfe to sée due punishment executed on the offendors that were foorthwith
taken and knowne to be guiltie in that conspiracie.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Dulcitius is appointed to put Valentinus to death.</span>
Theodosius committed Valentine with a few other of his trustie complices vnto the capteine
Dulcitius, commanding him to see them put to death: but coniecturing by his warlike skill
(wherein he passed all other in those daies) what might follow, he would not in anie wise
haue anie further inquirie made of the other conspirators, least through feare that might
be spread abroad in manie, the troubles of the prouinces now well quieted, should be
againe reuiued. After this, Theodosius disposing himselfe to redresse manie things as néed
required, all danger was quite remooued: so that it was most apparent, that fortune fauored
him in such wise, that she left him not destitute of hir furtherance in anie one of all his
attempts. He therefore restored the cities &amp; castels that were appointed to be kept with
garrisons, and the borders he caused to be defended and garded with sufficient numbers to
keépe watch and ward in places necessarie. And hauing recouered the prouince which the
enimies had gotten into their possession, he so restored it to the former state, that vpon
<span class="rightnote">A part of Britaine called Valentia.</span>
his motion to haue it so, a lawfull gouernour was assigned to rule it, and the name was
changed, so as from thencefoorth it should be called Valentia for the princes pleasure.</p>
<p>
The Areani, a kind of men ordeined in times past by our elders (of whome somewhat
we haue spoken in the acts of the emperour Constance) being now by little and little fallen
into vices, he remooued from their places of abiding, being openlie conuicted, that allured
with bribes and faire promises, they had oftentimes bewraied vnto the barbarous nations
what was doone among the Romans: for this was their charge, to runne vp and downe by
long iournies, and to giue warning to our captains, what sturre the people of the next
confines were about to make.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">The praise of Theodosius.</span>
Theodosius therefore hauing ordered these &amp; other like things, most woorthilie &amp; to his
high fame, was called home to the emperours court, who leauing the prouinces in most
triumphant state, was highlie renowmed for his often and most profitable victories, as if he
had béene an other Camillus or Cursor Papirius, and with the fauor and loue of all men<span class="page"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>[Page&nbsp;547]</span>
was conueied vnto the sea side; and passing ouer with a gentle wind, came to the court,
where he was receiued with great gladnesse and commendation, being immediatlie appointed
to succéed in the roome of Valence Iouinus that was maister of the horsses. Finallie, he
was called by the emperour Gratianus, to be associated with him in the imperiail estate, after
<span class="rightnote">379.</span>
the death of Valence, in the yeare after the incarnation of our Sauior 379, and reigned emperour,
surnamed Thodosius the great, about 16 yeares and 2 daies.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Wil. Har.</i></span>
Hereto also maie that be applied which the foresaid Marcellinus writeth in the same booke,
<span class="leftnote"><i> Walf. Lazi.</i></span>
touching the inuasion of the Saxons, the which (as Wolf. Lazius taketh it) entred then first
into great Britaine, but were repelled of the emperour Valentinianus the first, by the conduct
<span class="rightnote">Seuerus.</span>
and guiding of Seuerus. The same yéere (saith he) that the emperours were the third time
consuls, there brake forth a multitude of Saxons, &amp; passing the seas, entred stronglie into
the Romane confines: a nation fed oftentimes with the slaughter of our people, the brunt
<span class="rightnote">Nonneus Comes.</span>
of whose first inuasion earle Nonneus sustained, one which was appointed to defend those
parties, an approoued capteine, &amp; with continuall trauell in warres verie expert. But then
incountring with desperate and forlorne people, when he perceiued some of his souldiers to
be ouerthrowne and beaten downe, and himselfe wounded, not able to abide the often assaults
of his enimies, he obteined this by informing the emperour what was necessarie and
<span class="rightnote">Seuerus coronell of the footmen.</span>
ought to be doone, insomuch that Seuerus, maister or (as I maie call him) coronell of the
footmen, was sent to helpe and reléeue things that stood in danger: the which bringing a
sufficient power with him for the state of that businesse, when he came to those places, he
diuiding his armie into parts, put the Saxons in such feare and trouble before they fought,
that they did not so much as take weapon in hand to make resistance, but being amazed
with the sight of the glittering ensignes, &amp; the eagles figured in the Romane standards, they
streight made sute for peace, and at length after the matter was debated in sundrie wise
(because it was judged that it should be profitable for the Romane commonwealth) truce
was granted vnto them, and manie yoong men (able for seruice in the warres) deliuered to
the Romans according to the couenants concluded.</p>
<p>
After this the Saxons were permitted to depart without impeachment, &amp; so to returne
from whence they came, who being now out of all feare, and preparing to go their waies,
diuers bands of footmen were sent to lie priuilie in a certeine hid vallie so ambushed, as
they might easilie breake foorth vpon the enimies as they passed by them. But it chanced
far otherwise than they supposed, for certeine of those footmen stirred with the noise of
them as they were comming, brake foorth out of time, and being suddenlie discouered
whilest they hasted to vnite and knit themselues togither, by the hideous crie and shout of
the Saxons they were put to flight. Yet by and by closing togither againe, they staied, and
the extremitie of the chance ministring to them force (though not sufficient) they were
driuen to fight it out, and being beaten downe with great slaughter, had died euerie mothers
sonne, if a troope of horssemen armed at all points (being in like maner placed in an other
side at the entring of the waie to assaile the enimies as they should passe) aduertised by
the dolefull noise of them that fought, had not spéedilie come to the succour of their
fellowes.</p>
<p>
Then ran they togither more cruellie than before, and the Romans bending themselues
towards their enimies, compassed them in on each side, and with drawne swords slue them
downe right, so that there was not one of them left to returne home to their natiue countrie
to bring newes how they had sped, nor one suffered to liue after anothers death, either to
reuenge their ruine, or to lament their losse. Thus were the limits of the Romane empire
preserued at that time in Britaine, which should séeme to be about the yéere of our Lord
<span class="rightnote">399.</span>
399.</p>
<p>
¶ Thus were the Romans, as commonlie in all their martiall affaires, so in this incounter
verie fortunate, the happie issue of the conflict falling out on their side. And strange it is
to consider and marke, how these people by a celestiall kind of influence were begotten and
borne as it were to prowesse and renowme; the course of their dealings in the field most<span class="page"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>[Page&nbsp;548]</span>
aptlie answering to their name. For (as some suppose) the Romans were called of the
<span class="rightnote"><i>Solinus. Adr. Iun.</i></span>
Gréeke word ´&rho;&#974;&mu;&eta;, signifieng power and mightinesse: and in old time they were called
Valentians, <i>A valendo</i>, of preuailing: so that it was no maruell though they were victorious
subduers of forren people, sithens they were by nature created and appointed to be conquerors,
and thereof had their denomination.</p>

<i>What the poet Claudianus saith of the state of Britaine in the decaie of the Romane empire,
of the Scots and Picts cruellie vexing the Britains, they are afflicted by inuasion
of barbarous nations, the practise of the Saxons, of the Scots first comming into this
Iland, and from whence, the Scotish chonographers noted for curiositie and vanitie.</i></p>

<h3>THE XXXV CHAPTER.</h3>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Honorius the emperour.</span>
After this, in the time of the emperour Honorius, the Scots, Picts, and Saxons, did eftsoones
inuade the frontiers of the Romane prouince in Britaine, as appéereth by that which
the poet Claudianus writeth, in attributing the honour of preseruing the same frontiers vnto
<span class="leftnote">396.  <i>Claudianus.</i></span>
the said emperour, in his booke intituled "Panegerycus tertij consulatus" (which fell in the
yéere 396) as thus:</p>

<p class="indent">
Ille leues Mauros nec falso nomine Pictos<br />
Edomuit, Scotúmq; vago mucrone secutus,<br />
Fregit Hyperboreas remis audacibus vndas,<br />
Et geminis fulgens vtróq; sub axe tropheis,<br />
Tethyos alternae refluas calcauit arenas.<br /><br />

The nimble Mores and Picts by right<br />
<span class="indent1">so cald, he hath subdude,</span><br />
And with his wandring swoord likewise<br />
<span class="indent1">the Scots he hath pursude:</span><br />
He brake with bold couragious oare<br />
<span class="indent1">the Hyperborean waue,</span><br />
And shining vnder both the poles<br />
<span class="indent1">with double trophies braue,</span><br />
He marcht vpon the bubling sands<br />
<span class="indent1">of either swelling seas.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The same Claudianus vpon the fourth consulship of Honorius, saith in a tetrastichon as
followeth:</p>

<p class="indent">
Quid rigor æternus cæli? quid frigora prosunt?<br />
Ignotúmq; fretum? maduerunt Saxone fuso<br />
Orcades, incaluit Pictonum sanguine Thule,<br />
Scotorum cumulos fleuit glacialis Hyberne.<br /><br />

What lasting cold? what did to them<br />
<span class="indent1">the frostie climats gaine?</span><br />
And sea vnknowne? bemoisted all<br />
<span class="indent1">with bloud of Saxons slaine</span><br />
The Orknies were: with bloud of Picts<br />
<span class="rightnote">Thule some take to be Iseland, some Scotland.</span>
<span class="indent1">hath Thule waxed warme,</span><br />
And ysie Ireland hath bewaild<br />
<span class="indent1">the heaps of Scotish harme.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
The same praise giueth he to Stilico the sonne in law of Honorius, and maketh mention<span class="page"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>[Page&nbsp;549]</span>
of a legion of souldiers sent for out of Britaine in the periphrasis or circumlocution of the
Gotish bloudie warres:</p>

<p class="indent">
Venit &amp; extremis legio prætenta Britannis,<br />
Quas Scoto dat fræna truci, ferróq; notatas<br />
Perleget exanimes Picto moriente figuras.<br /><br />

A legion eke there came from out<br />
<span class="indent1">the farthest Britains bent,</span><br />
Which brideled hath the Scots so sterne:<br />
<span class="indent1">and marks with iron brent</span><br />
Vpon their liuelesse lims dooth read,<br />
<span class="indent1">whiles Picts their liues relent.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
He rehearseth the like in his second "Panegerycus" of Stilico, in most ample and pithie
manner insuing:</p>

<p class="indent">
Inde Calidonio velata Britannia monstro,<br />
Ferro Picta genas, cuius vestigia verrit<br />
Cærulus, Oceaniq; æstum mentitur amictus,<br />
Me quoq; vicinis pereuntem gentibus inquit,<br />
Muniuit Stilico, totam quum Scotus Hybernam<br />
Mouit, &amp; infesto spumauit remige Thetis,<br />
Illius effectum curis, ne bella timerem<br />
Scotica, ne Pictum tremerem, ne littore toto<br />
Prospicerem dubijs venturum Saxona ventis.<br /><br />

Then Britaine whom the monsters did<br />
<span class="indent1">of Calidone surround,</span><br />
Whose cheekes were pearst with scorching steele,<br />
<span class="indent1">whose garments swept the ground,</span><br />
Resembling much the marble hew<br />
<span class="indent1">of ocean seas that boile,</span><br />
Said, She whom neighbour nations did<br />
<span class="indent1">conspire to bring to spoile,</span><br />
Hath Stilico munited strong, when<br />
<span class="indent1">raised by Scots entice</span><br />
All Ireland was, and enimies ores<br />
<span class="indent1">the salt sea fome did slice,</span><br />
His care hath causd, that I all feare<br />
<span class="indent1">of Scotish broiles haue bard,</span><br />
Ne doo I dread the Picts, ne looke<br />
<span class="indent1">my countrie coasts to gard</span><br />
Gainst Saxon troops, whom changing winds<br />
<span class="indent1">sent sailing hitherward.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote">Britaine afflicted by inuasion of barbarous nations.</span>
Thus maie it appéere, that in the time when the Romane empire began to decaie, in like manner
as other parts of the same empire were inuaded by barbarous nations, so was that
part of Britaine which was subiect to the Romane emperors grieuouslie assailed by the
Scots and Picts, and also by the Saxons, the which in those daies inhabiting all alongst the
sea coasts of low Germanie, euen from the Elbe vnto the Rhine, did not onelie trouble the
sea by continuall rouing, but also vsed to come on land into diuerse parts of Britaine and
Gallia, inuading the countries, and robbing the same with great rage and crueltie.</p>
<p>
<span class="rightnote"><i>Sidon. <br />Apol. li. 8. Epist.</i></span><span class="page"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>[Page&nbsp;550]</span>
To the which Sidonius Apollinaris thus alludeth, writing to Namatius. "The messenger
did assuredlie affirme, that latelie ye blew the trumpet to warre in your nation, and betwixt
the office one while of a mariner, and another while of a souldier, wafted about the
<span class="leftnote">The pirasie of the Saxons.</span>
crooked shores of the ocean sea against the fléet of the Saxons, of whome as manie rouers
as ye behold, so manie archpirats ye suppose to sée: so doo they altogither with one accord
command, obeie, teach, and learne to plaie the parts of rouers, that euen now there is good
occasion to warne you to beware. This enimie is more cruell than all other enimies. He
assaileth at vnwares, he escapeth by forseeing the danger afore hand, he despiseth those that
stand against him, he throweth downe the vnwarie: if he be followed he snappeth them
vp that pursue him, if he flée he escapeth."</p>
<p>
Of like effect for proofe héereof be those verses which he wrote vnto Maiorianus his
panegyrike oration, following in Latine and in English verse.</p>

<p class="indent">
Tot maria intraui duce te, longéq; remotas<br />

<p>
¶ Thus much haue we thought good to gather out of the Romane and other writers, that
ye might perceiue the state of Britaine the better in that time of the decaie of the Romane
empire, and that ye might haue occasion to marke by the waie, how not onelie the Scots,
but also the Saxons had attempted to inuade the Britains, before anie mention is made of
the same their attempts by the British and English writers. But whether the Scots had anie
habitation within the bounds of Britaine, till the time supposed by the Britaine writers, we
leaue that point to the iudgement of others that be trauelled in the search of such antiquities,
onelie admonishing you, that in the Scotish chronicle you shall find the opinion which their
writers haue conceiued of this matter, and also manie things touching the acts of the Romans
doone against diuerse of the Britains, which they presume to be doone against their
nation, though shadowed vnder the generall name of Britains, or of other particular names,
at this daie to most men vnknowne. But whensoeuer the Scots came into this Ile, they made
the third nation that inhabited the same, comming first out of Scithia, or rather out of Spaine
<span class="rightnote"><i>Polydor</i>.</span>
(as some suppose) into Ireland, and from thence into Britaine; next after the Picts, though
their writers fetch a farre more ancient beginning (as in their chronicles at large appéereth) referring
them to the reading thereof, that desire to vnderstand that matter as they set it foorth.</p>
<br />
<p class="center">
<i>Thus farre the dominion and tribute of the Romans ouer this land of Britaine,<br />
which had continued (by the collection of some chronographers)<br />
   the space of 483. yeeres. And heere we thinke it<br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
